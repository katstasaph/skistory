I told myself I wasn't going to ski long. 
Or ski far. 
Or ski too fast. 
I don't know how to ski.
 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
I've gone    00m now. 
I'm going    00m/s. 
Am I skiing well? 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
The scenery blurs into itself. 
Wind like encroaching walls. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I've gone    00m now. 
They briefed me on the symbols for the difficulty of slopes. Green circle, easy. Blue square, medium. Black diamond, hard. Every ski slope has one. But this one didn't. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. 
I'm going    03m/s. 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
Where have all the people gone? 
Am I skiing well? 
If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
Wind like encroaching walls. How far down can this slope go? 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
The snow is infinite. 
Where have all the people gone? 
I've gone    05m now. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. 
I'm going    13m/s. 
A man drifts past me. His eyes are dead. I can't say for certain the rest of him isn't. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Am I skiing well? 
How far down can this slope go? 
Gravity controls me totally. 
I try to remember whether I brought a watch. 
How far down can this slope go? Where have all the people gone? 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
I've gone    16m now. 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? 
I'm going    21m/s. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
I never really thought about gravity before. But gravity feels heavier here. It feels like what it is: a force beyond you pressing you into the earth. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze.

I'm going    10m/s. 
A finger goes numb. Then another. The numbness creeps up my arm and further down my body, in a strange pattern I can't quite place. 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Am I skiing well? 
Out of the snow appears a ski lift. Inside are two men. They stare blankly and still. The snow moves more than they do. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I remember peripheral vision. A 360-degree world. A world with more than these two things: forward, and snow. Where have all the people gone? 
I try to remember whether I brought a watch. 
Snow like static in the ears. 
The snow never ceases. 
I've gone   999m now. Going back feels wrong. 
All my senses collapse into the same sense: cold, movement, nothingness. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I'm going    19m/s. 
How far down can this slope go? 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. How far down can this slope go?

Keep moving. There is no other choice. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
It feels like I've been skiing here forever. 
Snow stinging the eyes. 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? 
I've gone   985m now. 
Wind like encroaching walls. If I close my eyes I'll crash.

Cold in the bones. 
I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're closing in. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I've gone   971m now. 
No one told me it would be this quiet. No one told me that when all sounds cease, you hear the snow. You never stop hearing it. Just keep going... 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? Where have all the people gone? 
I'm going    21m/s. 
A man topples over and falls fast. Something in his movement unsettles me, but before I can place it he's there and gone. 
Snow stinging the eyes. Keep moving. There is no other choice.

Cold in the bones. Why did I agree to do this? 
I've collapsed. Face meets snow. Whenever I fall I wonder when the last time will be. 
These people leave no footprints. Nor do the skis. Nothing leaves a mark. I have to keep breathing. 
Wind like encroaching walls.

Crashed. Limbs topple over swaddled limbs and I'm facedown in the show. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
I suck at skiing. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing.

Out of the corner of my eye I see something seeping through the ice, an unnatural color. But when I look back it's gone. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. 
I've gone   957m now. 
How far down can this slope go? 
A woman freezes. From a tree, a tendril. Tendrils around the skis, the hair, the rest. And then, snow.

I've gone  1363m now. Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. 
Wind like encroaching walls. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
The snow is infinite. I have to keep breathing.

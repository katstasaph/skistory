I told myself I wasn't going to ski long. 
Or ski far. 
Or ski too fast. 
I don't know how to ski.
 
I try to remember whether I brought a watch. 
I've gone    00m now. 
I'm going    00m/s. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. How does one even know? 
I try to remember whether I brought a watch. 
Wind like encroaching walls. Where have all the people gone? 
They briefed me on the symbols for the difficulty of slopes. Green circle, easy. Blue square, medium. Black diamond, hard. Every ski slope has one. But this one didn't. 
I've gone    00m now. 
All my senses collapse into the same sense: cold, movement, nothingness. 
Snow like static in the ears. 
I'm going    00m/s. 
I think about the fact that a person created this place, laid it out and scattered the snow and cut the trees and smoothed the slope and invited the world. They would want it to be safe. I have to remember that. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. How does one even know? 
I have to keep breathing. 
The snow is infinite. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
Snow like static in the ears. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
A finger goes numb. Then another. The numbness creeps up my arm and further down my body, in a strange pattern I can't quite place. 
I've gone    00m now. 
Snow like static in the ears. 
Keep moving. There is no other choice. Why did I agree to do this? 
I'm going    00m/s. 
The scenery blurs into itself. 
Cold in the bones. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. How does one even know? 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
Out of the corner of my eye I see something seeping through the ice, an unnatural color. But when I look back it's gone. Where have all the people gone? 
Snow that deafens and numbs. 
I've gone    00m now. 
Snow like static in the ears. 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I'm going    00m/s. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. How does one even know? 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. 
The scenery blurs into itself. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I've gone    00m now. 
I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're closing in. 
Where have all the people gone? 
I'm going    00m/s. 
A woman freezes. From a tree, a tendril. Tendrils around the skis, the hair, the rest. And then, snow. 
The scenery blurs into itself. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. How does one even know? 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
Gravity controls me totally. I ski on autopilot, outside myself.

Snow that deafens and numbs. 
If I focus, I'll get out of here faster. Why did I agree to do this? 
I've gone    00m now. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
No one told me it would be this quiet. No one told me that when all sounds cease, you hear the snow. You never stop hearing it. How far down can this slope go? 
I'm going    00m/s. 
A man topples over and falls fast. Something in his movement unsettles me, but before I can place it he's there and gone. 
A world of nothing but ice. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. How does one even know? 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Snow like static in the ears.

Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. 
I'm going    01m/s. 
Out of the snow appears a ski lift. Inside are two men. They stare blankly and still. The snow moves more than they do.

If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I've gone    12m now. 
I never really thought about gravity before. But gravity feels heavier here. It feels like what it is: a force beyond you pressing you into the earth. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
I'm going    19m/s. 
One ski in front of the other. 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze.

One ski in front of the other. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I've gone  1715m now. The only thing more unsettling than a darkening sky: a sky that never darkens.

The scenery blurs into itself. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. I have to keep breathing. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
One ski in front of the other. How far down can this slope go? 
The snow is infinite. 
I've gone    00m now. I fight gravity to pull myself back uphill. 
Why are so many trees dead? I have to keep breathing. 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? Where have all the people gone? 
I'm going    00m/s. 
Why are so many trees dead? My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Cold in the bones. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. What I should ask is whether I'm still alive. 
Snow stinging the eyes. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Just keep going... 
It feels like I've been skiing here forever. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
The snow never ceases. 
I've gone    00m now. 
Snow like static in the ears. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. How far down can this slope go? 
I'm going    00m/s. 
Why are so many trees dead? Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
The scenery blurs into itself. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why? 
Just keep going...

Each breath takes more effort than the last. 
How far down can this slope go? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. What I should ask is whether I'm still alive. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. 
A man whizzes by with impossible, inhuman speed. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. I have to keep breathing. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. 
I've gone    00m now. 
The snow never ceases. Where have all the people gone? 
Just keep going... 
I'm going    00m/s. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me. 
One ski in front of the other. 
Wind like encroaching walls. Just keep going... 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
I have to keep breathing. 
If I focus, I'll get out of here faster. 
I've gone    00m now. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
Gravity controls me totally. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I'm going    00m/s. 
The snow never ceases. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
Where have all the people gone? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why? 
Snow stinging the eyes. 
The snow never ceases. Why did I agree to do this?

Wind like encroaching walls. 
I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're closing in. How far down can this slope go?

Cold in the bones. 
Just keep going...

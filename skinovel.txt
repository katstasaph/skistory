I told myself I wasn't going to ski long. 
Or ski far. 
Or ski too fast. 
I don't know how to ski.
 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
I've gone 0 meters now. 
The snowfall keeps me down. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. How does one even know?
 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. Why did I agree to do this? 
Cold deep in the bones. 
I've gone 0 meters now. 
Wind like encroaching walls. How far down can this slope go? 
Gravity controls me completely. How far down can this slope go? 
I'm going 1 meters per hour. 
Just keep going... 
Out of the snow appears a ski lift. Inside are two men. They stare blankly and still. The snow moves more than they do. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. As if anyone's keeping score.
 
A man drifts past me. His eyes are dead. I can't say for certain the rest of him isn't. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
A sign tells me how to gain better control. But I don't understand what it's telling me. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I've gone 1 meters now. 
Snow like static in the ears. I have to keep breathing. 
Cold deep in the bones. Where have all the people gone? 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
A world of nothing but ice. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. How does one even know?
 
Everything freezes before my eyes. 
A finger goes numb. Then another. The numbness creeps up my arm and further down my body, in a strange pattern I can't quite place. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
On ski slopes all landmarks are manmade, so these rocks must be manmade too. But they don't feel planned. They jut out of the snow at violently irregular intervals, like something punching its way free. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I've gone 5 meters now. 
A man whizzes by with impossible, inhuman speed. 
Snow stinging the eyes. 
I'm going 17 meters per hour. 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
The snow is infinite. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. As if anyone's keeping score.
 
One ski in front of the other. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
I try to remember whether I brought a watch. 
They briefed me on the symbols for the difficulty of slopes. Green circle, easy. Blue square, medium. Black diamond, hard. Every ski slope has one. But this one didn't. 
Cold deep in the bones. The slope will end in time. 
I've gone 12 meters now. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. 
No one told me it would be this quiet. No one told me that when all sounds cease, you hear the snow. You never stop hearing it. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. I have to keep breathing. 
All my senses collapse into the same sense: cold, movement, nothingness. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. How does one even know?
 
Gravity controls me completely. The people passing by all look the same. 
A world of nothing but ice. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. 
I've gone 18 meters now. 
The trees must be moving. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
Everything freezes before my eyes. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I'm going 16 meters per hour. 
A man topples over and falls fast. Something in his movement unsettles me, but before I can place it he's there and gone. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. How far down can this slope go? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. How does one even know?
 
I never really thought about gravity before. But gravity feels heavier here. It feels like what it is: a force beyond you pressing you into the earth. Just keep going... 
One ski in front of the other. Just keep going... 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
I think about the fact that a person created this place, laid it out and scattered the snow and cut the trees and smoothed the slope and invited the world. They would want it to be safe. I have to remember that. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
The scenery blurs into itself. 
I've gone 23 meters now. 
Just keep going... The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. 
Just keep going... 
A world of nothing but ice. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But out here there's no way to know.
 
Snow stinging the eyes. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
Cold finds its way into everything. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
Cold finds its way into everything. Air that annihilates. 
I have to keep breathing. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I've gone 25 meters now. 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. I have to keep breathing. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. 
Snow stinging the eyes. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
The tree stumps are too neat. Somehow inorganic. Clean decapitations everywhere. The slope will end in time. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. As if anyone's keeping score.
 
Gravity controls me completely. 
The slope was established in 1991, according to a sign. What was here before? Was it anything? But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. 
The snow never ceases. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I've gone 28 meters now. 
I remember peripheral vision. A 360-degree world. A world with more than these two things: forward, and snow. I have to keep breathing. 
How far down can this slope go? Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. 
I pass something with a foul, unplacable odor that lingers longer than it should. But when I turn around, I see nothing. Not even a footprint. 
Just keep going... 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. How does one even know?
 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. 
Out of the corner of my eye I see something seeping through the ice, an unnatural color. But when I look back it's gone. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. How far down can this slope go? 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
I've gone 31 meters now. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again.

Just keep going... I have to keep breathing. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. Everything freezes before my eyes.

Do I have any skin left to go numb? I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Cold deep in the bones. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. How far down can this slope go? 
The snow is infinite. I have to keep breathing. 
I've gone 33 meters now. 
Just keep going... 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. 
A woman freezes. From a tree, a tendril. Tendrils around the skis, the hair, the rest. And then, snow. 
The scenery blurs into itself. Air that annihilates. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. How does one even know?
 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. Where have all the people gone?

Air that annihilates. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
A world of nothing but ice.

Snow and snow and snow and snow. Where have all the people gone? 
There is only one option: keep skiing. An all-encompassing sense of chill.

No time to shiver. I have to keep breathing.

I'm going 21 meters per hour. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. No time to shiver. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. Air that annihilates. 
Cold finds its way into everything. 
I must have been out here something like  0:02:39.64. 
One ski in front of the other. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I've gone 1203 meters now. The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're slowly strangling me. 
Everything freezes before my eyes. I have to keep breathing. 
How far down can this slope go? 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. 
Wind like encroaching walls. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
The scenery blurs into itself. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. What I should ask is whether I'm still alive.

Cold finds its way into everything.

I've gone 1258 meters now. I won't say I'm lost. I can't. Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. The slope will end in time. 
The scenery blurs into itself. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Every movement airborne feels so impossibly precarious. The wind's too loud up here. It wants me down.

NO ESCAPE NO ESCAPE

I've gone 1297 meters now. The only thing more unsettling than a darkening sky: a sky that never darkens. There are scents now, each more acrid than the last. 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. 
Something out of my control propels me forward and up. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH

I've gone 1549 meters now. A wasteland of ice now. It occurs to me that the slope wants me gone. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
How far down can this slope go? Where have all the people gone? 
I'm going 11 meters per hour. 
Where have all the people gone? 
The snow is infinite. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Everything freezes before my eyes. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I must have been out here something like  0:02:39.64. 
Gravity controls me completely. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
A world of nothing but ice. Where have all the people gone? 
I've gone 1558 meters now. Still no end in sight. Nothing. The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. No time to shiver. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. 
Why are so many trees dead? Ice encrusting everything in view. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS

I must have been out here something like  0:02:39.64. 
Just keep going... 
How far down can this slope go? 
I've gone 1569 meters now. Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. The only thing more unsettling than a darkening sky: a sky that never darkens. 
Snow like static in the ears. 

THEIR COMPULSION TO SEE IT TO THE END
 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. Where have all the people gone? 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop.

There are no landmarks anywhere. 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. How far down can this slope go? 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. 
A world of nothing but ice. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. Just keep going...

I'm going 16 meters per hour.

The snow never ceases. Air that annihilates. 
If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I've gone 1616 meters now. The footprints don't look like footprints anymore. They look like trails. Like being dragged and leaving marks. I should have reached the bottom by now.

Snow that deafens and numbs. Just keep going... 
The snow never ceases. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. No time to shiver. 
No time to shiver. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I must have been out here something like  0:02:39.64. 
Where have all the people gone? No time to shiver. 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
Snow stinging the eyes. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I've gone 1846 meters now. The footprints don't look like footprints anymore. They look like trails. Like being dragged and leaving marks. 
Wind like encroaching walls. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
A world of nothing but ice. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. 
Snow like static in the ears. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Snow stinging the eyes. No time to shiver. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Why did I agree to do this? 
Snow that deafens and numbs. Where have all the people gone? 
I must have been out here something like  0:02:39.64. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. Just keep going... 

NO ESCAPE NO ESCAPE
 
Just keep going... Air that annihilates. 
I've gone 1859 meters now. The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. 

NO ESCAPE NO ESCAPE
 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
The snow is infinite. Where have all the people gone? 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
The snow is infinite. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
The scenery blurs into itself. Air that annihilates. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I must have been out here something like  0:02:39.64. 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
The snow never ceases. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I've gone 1873 meters now. I can't stop moving. The snow will swallow me, I know. Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. I have to keep breathing. 
From the air, the ground seems impossibly far away. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Air that annihilates. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
The scenery looks like a snowglobe: picturesque, inescapable. Just keep going... 
I must have been out here something like  0:02:39.64. 
Just keep going... No time to shiver. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
Snow stinging the eyes. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I've gone 1892 meters now. I can't stop moving. The snow will swallow me, I know. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. I have to keep breathing. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. 
From the air, the ground seems impossibly far away. I feel myself moving faster while airborne. Is that good? 
Cold deep in the bones. 
I don't remember when I started holding my breath. Something is holding it for me. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. What I should ask is whether I'm still alive.
 
The scenery blurs into itself. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
One ski in front of the other. No time to shiver. 
I must have been out here something like  0:02:39.64. 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. Why did I agree to do this? 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
How far down can this slope go? 
I've gone 1906 meters now. I don't want to be here anymore. I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're slowly strangling me. 

THEIR COMPULSION TO SEE IT TO THE END
 
Gravity controls me completely. 
Snow like static in the ears. 
I'm going 13 meters per hour. 

THE TIME HAS COME
 
Gravity controls me completely. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
The trees must be moving. Why did I agree to do this? 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH

I must have been out here something like  0:02:39.64. 
One ski in front of the other. 
Gravity controls me completely. 
I've gone 1916 meters now. The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. The slope will end in time. 
One ski in front of the other. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour.

Cold finds its way into everything. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. 
I must have been out here something like  0:02:39.64. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
Snow that deafens and numbs. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I've gone 1929 meters now. Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. 
The snow never ceases. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour.

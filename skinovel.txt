I told myself I wasn't going to ski long. 
Or ski far. 
Or ski too fast. 
I don't know how to ski. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
Just keep going... 
Just keep going... 
I've gone    00m meters now. 
Out of the snow appears a ski lift. Inside are two men. They stare blankly and still. The snow moves more than they do. 
Snow like static in the ears. 
I'm going    00m/s. 
Where have all the people gone? 
Just keep going... 
Am I skiing well? 
I have to keep breathing. 
One ski in front of the other. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
The scenery blurs into itself. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. 
I've gone    00m meters now. 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. 
I'm going    02m/s. 
Snow stinging the eyes. 
A finger goes numb. Then another. The numbness creeps up my arm and further down my body, in a strange pattern I can't quite place. 
Am I skiing well? 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
I never really thought about gravity before. But gravity feels heavier here. It feels like what it is: a force beyond you pressing you into the earth. 
If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I've gone    02m meters now. It takes all my energy to go back. 
No one told me it would be this quiet. No one told me that when all sounds cease, you hear the snow. You never stop hearing it. 
Cold in the bones. 
I'm going    11m/s. 
Snow like static in the ears. 
They briefed me on the symbols for the difficulty of slopes. Green circle, easy. Blue square, medium. Black diamond, hard. Every ski slope has one. But this one didn't.

I remember peripheral vision. A 360-degree world. A world with more than these two things: forward, and snow. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
Snow like static in the ears. 
A man freezes. From a tree, a tendril. Tendrils around the skis, the hair, the rest. And then, snow. 
I've gone    14m meters now. It takes all my energy to go back. 
The snow never ceases.

I told myself I wasn't going to ski long. 
Or ski far. 
Or ski too fast. 
I don't know how to ski. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
The weather was supposed to be cold. But not this cold. 
I've gone    00m now. 
Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. 
I'm going    00m/s. 
There were supposed to be more signposts. 
Snow like static in the ears. 
Am I skiing well? 
The scenery blurs into itself. 
Just keep going... 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. 
Nothing looks like what the map said. 
I've gone    00m now. 
The snow is infinite. 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? 
I'm going    00m/s. 
A finger goes numb. Then another. The numbness creeps up my arm and further down my body, in a strange pattern I can't quite place. 
All my senses collapse into the same sense: cold, movement, nothingness. 
Am I skiing well? 
Cold in the bones. 
There were supposed to be more signposts. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
Snow like static in the ears.

I don't know how long I've been out here. 
Out of the snow appears a ski lift. Inside are two men. They stare blankly and still. The snow moves more than they do. 
Cold in the bones. 
I've gone    02m now. It takes all my energy to hoist my skis upward and go back. 
Just keep going... 
The scenery blurs into itself. 
I'm going    13m/s. 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. 
No one told me it would be this quiet. No one told me that when all sounds cease, you hear the snow. You never stop hearing it. 
Am I skiing well? 
Where have all the people gone? 
They briefed me on the symbols for the difficulty of slopes. Green circle, easy. Blue square, medium. Black diamond, hard. Every ski slope has one. But this one didn't. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
There were supposed to be more signposts.

Just keep going... 
I never really thought about gravity before. But gravity feels heavier here. It feels like what it is: a force beyond you pressing you into the earth. 
I'm going    21m/s. 
I have to keep breathing. 
One ski in front of the other. 
Am I skiing well?

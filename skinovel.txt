I told myself I wasn't going to ski long. 
Or ski far. 
Or ski too fast. 
I don't know how to ski.
 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
I've gone 0 meters now. Is that all? 
The slope passes me by. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. How does one even know?
 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
Gravity controls me completely. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Cold deep in the bones. 
I've gone 0 meters now. Such a small number, on paper. 
The slope was established in 1991, according to a sign. Who did it? What was here before? Was it anything? The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. A thousand ways to describe the cold. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. The people passing by all look the same. 
I pause to catch my breath. But it remains the same. Did I really think stopping would help? The slope looks infinite when viewed from the ground. 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. If I ever reach the bottom, maybe I'll ask.
 
Snow like static in the ears. I have to keep breathing. 
The scenery blurs into itself. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
No watches are allowed here. 
These people leave no footprints. Nor do the skis. Nothing leaves a mark. Snow shrouds everything around me. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
No one told me it would be this quiet. No one told me that when all sounds cease, you hear the snow. You never stop hearing it. 
I've gone 0 meters now. Is that all? 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. Everything freezes before my eyes. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
An eternity of winter. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
Snow like static in the ears. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. An all-encompassing sense of chill. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But out here there's no way to know.
 
Wind like encroaching walls. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Nothing to do but ski and survive. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
The scenery blurs into itself. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
All my senses collapse into the same sense: cold, movement, nothingness. Selective sensory deprivation. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
Something moving underneath the snowbanks. Some sort of protuberance, something from deep below. I can't look back. Keep moving. There is no other choice. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
I've gone 7 meters now. Is that all? 
All they told me about this slope was that it was free. Free of charge. Free of rules. Or free as in falling. Nothing to do but ski and survive. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Cold deep in the bones. If I close my eyes I'll crash. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
I'm going 17 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
A finger goes numb. Then another. The numbness creeps up my arm and further down my body, in a strange pattern I can't quite place. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Snow shrouds everything around me. The people passing by all look the same. 
The scenery blurs into itself. Everything freezes before my eyes. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing I have a sense of is passing time.
 
Selective sensory deprivation. Everything freezes before my eyes. The people passing by all look the same. 
Cold deep in the bones. How far down can this slope go? 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
Cold finds its way into everything. Ice encrusting everything in view. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. 
I've gone 20 meters now. Is that all? 
Just keep going... 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
Everything freezes before my eyes. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
Selective sensory deprivation. Where have all the people gone? If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing I have a sense of is passing time.
 
The snow never ceases. There is only one option: keep skiing. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
An infinity of ice. No time to shiver. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? 
A sign tells me how to gain better control. But I don't understand what it's telling me. Chill down to the nerve endings. The slope will end in time. Just keep going... 
I've gone 32 meters now. And meters and meters to go. 
Just keep going... 
One ski in front of the other. Everything freezes before my eyes. No time to shiver. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I'm going 13 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
One ski in front of the other. 
Selective sensory deprivation. Why did I agree to do this? Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. How does one even know?
 
Snow shrouds everything around me. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Air that annihilates. 
Snow stinging the eyes. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
Cold finds its way into everything. 
I've gone 997 meters now. I fight gravity to pull myself back uphill. 
I don't remember when I started holding my breath. Something is holding it for me. 
Snow stinging the eyes. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. No time to shiver. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
They briefed me on the symbols for the difficulty of slopes. Green circle, easy. Blue square, medium. Black diamond, hard. Every ski slope has one. But this one didn't. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But out here there's no way to know.
 
Where have all the people gone? A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
Gravity controls me completely. Just keep going... Why did I agree to do this? 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
I remember peripheral vision. A 360-degree world. A world with more than these two things: forward, and snow. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
How far down can this slope go? Before me is more of the same. 
I've gone 985 meters now. Is that all? 
Everything freezes before my eyes. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Cold finds its way into everything. No time to shiver. 
Airborne, going 23 meters per hour. Flying, or flailing.

Each breath takes more effort than the last. Everything freezes before my eyes. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Peak skiing performance. I have to find comfort in this.
 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Just keep going... 
If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Have I been skiing for an hour? Two hours? Two days? It all feels the same. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Why did I agree to do this? 
An eternity of winter. Where have all the people gone? 
I've gone 967 meters now. Such a small number, on paper. 
I think about the fact that a person created this place, laid it out and scattered the snow and cut the trees and smoothed the slope and invited the world. They would want it to be safe. I have to remember that. No time to shiver. 
Just keep going... I have to keep breathing. No time to shiver. 
Airborne, going 30 meters per hour. Flying, or flailing. I have to trust there's flat ground below. I can't look down. The slope looks far too vast beneath me. 
I don't remember when I started holding my breath. Something is holding it for me. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Nothing to do but ski and survive. The people passing by all look the same. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. Ice encrusting everything in view. There is only one option: keep skiing. Where have all the people gone? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Practically a professional. I have to find comfort in this.

Snow like static in the ears. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
Airborne, going 26 meters per hour. Impossibly high. I feel myself moving faster while airborne. Is that good? The slope looks far too vast beneath me. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I can still do tricks, it seems.

The scenery blurs into itself. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
Cold deep in the bones. Chill down to the nerve endings. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I've gone 541 meters now. Such a small number, on paper. 
Where have all the people gone? Selective sensory deprivation. Why did I agree to do this? 
Selective sensory deprivation. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
Airborne, going 26 meters per hour. I have to stick the landing. I feel myself moving faster while airborne. Is that good? 
No time to shiver. An all-encompassing sense of chill. No time to shiver. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
How far down can this slope go? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The surge of confidence keeps me going. Another meter at least. Somehow I'm still upright. Small comforts. Somehow I'm still upright.
 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? An all-encompassing sense of chill. The slope will end in time. Just keep going... 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. How far down can this slope go? 
Every minute seems to last hours. 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. A thousand ways to describe the cold. Selective sensory deprivation. The people passing by all look the same. 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
I've gone 523 meters now. Such a small number, on paper. 
Cold finds its way into everything. My legs would ache if I could feel them. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Cold deep in the bones. Ice encrusting everything in view. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
Airborne, going 26 meters per hour. I have to stick the landing. Moving on wind and momentum alone. The wind's too loud up here. It wants me down. The slope looks far too vast beneath me. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. The slope will end in time. Air that annihilates. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Peak skiing performance.
 
Selective sensory deprivation. Nothing to do but ski and survive.

Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Keep moving. There is no other choice.

I don't remember when I started holding my breath. Something is holding it for me. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
Half the trees are splintered dead. Chill down to the nerve endings. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
One ski in front of the other. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Just keep going... I have to keep breathing. 
I've gone 496 meters now. Such a small number, on paper. 
Where have all the people gone? If I close my eyes I'll crash. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Snow stinging the eyes. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
An unnatural buzz to the wind.

I'm going 15 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 
Cold finds its way into everything. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. An all-encompassing sense of chill. The people passing by all look the same. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I can still do tricks, it seems.
 
Colder than cold.

Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? Air that annihilates. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? Air that annihilates. No time to shiver. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. No time to shiver. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
I've gone 1105 meters now. The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. An unending expanse produces its own kind of claustrophobia. I don't want to be here anymore. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
Where have all the people gone? If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Where have all the people gone? Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I'm going 5 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. Ice encrusting everything in view. Selective sensory deprivation. 
Wind like encroaching walls. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. If I close my eyes I'll crash. Just keep going... 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Chill down to the nerve endings. Selective sensory deprivation. 
One ski in front of the other. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 

THE TIME HAS COME
 
Selective sensory deprivation. How far down can this slope go? 
A world of nothing but ice. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Before me is more of the same. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I've gone 1111 meters now. The air sends spines to my face. An unending expanse produces its own kind of claustrophobia. 
Chill down to the nerve endings. There is only one option: keep skiing. No time to shiver. 
Cold deep in the bones. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I'm going 14 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
An infinity of ice. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. Just keep going... The people passing by all look the same. The slope will end in time. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Just keep going... The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I've gone 1120 meters now. The farther I go, the quieter it gets. An unending expanse produces its own kind of claustrophobia. If anything happened to me, the snow would bury any trace. The landscape is atrophying, and so am I. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
Why did I agree to do this? Everything freezes before my eyes. The people passing by all look the same. 
I'm going 13 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
The snow is infinite. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. The people passing by all look the same.

I just hope this will be over quick. 
I don't remember when I started holding my breath. Something is holding it for me. 
Just keep going... 
I've gone 1132 meters now. Snowdrifts start to look like chasms. The landscape is atrophying, and so am I. 
An eternity of winter. 
The scenery blurs into itself. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
Airborne, going 22 meters per hour. Something out of my control propels me forward and up. I have to trust there's flat ground below. I can't look down. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. My legs would ache if I could feel them. The slope will end in time. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Selective sensory deprivation. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
The snow never ceases. There is only one option: keep skiing. Why did I agree to do this? 

THE TIME HAS COME
 
Selective sensory deprivation. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. I have to keep breathing. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I've gone 1143 meters now. Snow gives way to fetid slush. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. 
Half the trees are splintered dead. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
Half the trees are splintered dead. Nothing to do but ski and survive.

I've gone 1155 meters now. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. I long so much for warmth. Is death warmer than here? 
Snow stinging the eyes. The slope will end in time. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I'm going 10 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
The scenery blurs into itself. 
No time to shiver. How far down can this slope go? My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
No watches are allowed here. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
I don't remember when I started holding my breath. Something is holding it for me. 
The scenery blurs into itself. I have to keep breathing. Air that annihilates. 
I've gone 1158 meters now. A bush is burning. Don't think about it. The landscape is atrophying, and so am I. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. How far down can this slope go? Why did I agree to do this? Everything freezes before my eyes. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
The snow never ceases. I have to keep breathing. Snow shrouds everything around me. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
I pause to catch my breath. But it remains the same. Gravity could keep me down here forever.

I've gone 1164 meters now. The footprints don't look like footprints anymore. They look like trails. Like being dragged and leaving marks. I long so much for warmth. My peripheral vision is gone. Just tunnel vision forward. An unending expanse produces its own kind of claustrophobia. 
The scenery looks like a snowglobe: picturesque, inescapable. Everything freezes before my eyes. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Chill down to the nerve endings.

Snow like static in the ears. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
The slope passes me by. 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference.

Selective sensory deprivation. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I'm going 8 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
One ski in front of the other. My legs would ache if I could feel them. Nothing to do but ski and survive. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
Just keep going... Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. The people passing by all look the same. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. I have to keep breathing. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. The slope will end in time. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I've gone 1298 meters now. Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. 
Snow like static in the ears. 
How far down can this slope go? 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 

THEIR COMPULSION TO SEE IT TO THE END
 
Air that annihilates. I have to keep breathing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Wind like encroaching walls. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. Selective sensory deprivation. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
Cold finds its way into everything.

One ski in front of the other. Air that annihilates. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what.

An unnatural buzz to the wind. If I close my eyes I'll crash. Where have all the people gone? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? The slope will end in time. Before me is more of the same.

An eternity of winter. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. A thousand ways to describe the cold. Where have all the people gone? Everything freezes before my eyes. 
The snow is infinite. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere.

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE

Half the trees are splintered dead. Chill down to the nerve endings. Keep moving. There is no other choice.

Chill down to the nerve endings. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 

THE TIME HAS COME
 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
Cold finds its way into everything. Ice encrusting everything in view. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Where have all the people gone? 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. The slope will end in time. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Before me is more of the same. 
I've gone 1460 meters now. Every tree I pass looks battered, gangrenous. 
These people leave no footprints. Nor do the skis. Nothing leaves a mark. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. A thousand ways to describe the cold. I have to keep breathing. 
An eternity of winter. Before me is more of the same. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I'm going 5 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I don't remember when I started holding my breath. Something is holding it for me. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Keep moving. There is no other choice. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. I have to keep breathing. Snow shrouds everything around me. The slope will end in time. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. How far down can this slope go? 
I've gone 1460 meters now. I won't say I'm lost. I can't. Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
Just keep going... Keep moving. There is no other choice. Ice encrusting everything in view. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
The snowfall keeps me down. Did I really think stopping would help? I'll get up if I feel ready. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
How far down can this slope go? A thousand ways to describe the cold. How far down can this slope go? The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
An infinity of ice. How far down can this slope go? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? 
Why did I agree to do this? Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
A world of nothing but ice. 
The snow never ceases. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Selective sensory deprivation. 
I've gone 1460 meters now. I can't stop moving. The snow will swallow me, I know. Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 

NO ESCAPE NO ESCAPE
 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I'm going 1 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
An eternity of winter. 
How far down can this slope go? If I close my eyes I'll crash. Why did I agree to do this? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
Just keep going... 
The scenery blurs into itself. The people passing by all look the same. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
The scenery blurs into itself. Air that annihilates. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
The scenery blurs into itself. 
I've gone 1463 meters now. Footprints, but not in a pattern. 
The scenery looks like a snowglobe: picturesque, inescapable. Everything freezes before my eyes. No time to shiver. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
No time to shiver. Before me is more of the same. 
I'm going 10 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. My legs would ache if I could feel them. The people passing by all look the same. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
Cold deep in the bones. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Where have all the people gone? 
Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I've gone 1473 meters now. It occurs to me that the slope wants me gone. An unending expanse produces its own kind of claustrophobia. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
Snow like static in the ears. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I'm going 19 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
The snow never ceases. Air that annihilates. Before me is more of the same. 
Wind like encroaching walls. There is only one option: keep skiing. An all-encompassing sense of chill.

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I've gone 1487 meters now. A bush is burning. Don't think about it. An unending expanse produces its own kind of claustrophobia. I don't want to be here anymore. The air sends spines to my face. 
The scenery blurs into itself. The slope will end in time. Nothing to do but ski and survive. I ski on autopilot, outside myself.

I've gone 1539 meters now. I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. My body doesn't ache exactly, and yet it feels like it should. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
How far down can this slope go? Where have all the people gone? 
Every millimeter seems to take hours. 
The snow never ceases. 
Selective sensory deprivation. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
Half the trees are splintered dead. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. Why did I agree to do this? Snow shrouds everything around me. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Where have all the people gone? Snow shrouds everything around me. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. 
I've gone 1537 meters now. I don't want to be here anymore. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Just keep going... 
I have to keep breathing. Chill down to the nerve endings. If I close my eyes I'll crash. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
Every millimeter seems to take hours. 
The snow never ceases. The people passing by all look the same. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
Snow stinging the eyes. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
Colder than cold. No time to shiver. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
No watches are allowed here. 
Half the trees are splintered dead. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
An infinity of ice. I have to keep breathing. Why did I agree to do this? 
I've gone 1534 meters now. Still no end in sight. Nothing. 
The scenery blurs into itself. Before me is more of the same. 
An infinity of ice. No time to shiver. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
Gravity slows and sedates me. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Air that annihilates. An all-encompassing sense of chill. How far down can this slope go? 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
A world of nothing but ice. 
If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 

IN THE END THEY'RE ALWAYS DRAWN
 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
Colder than cold. 
I've gone 1532 meters now. Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. Selective sensory deprivation. I have to keep breathing. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. 
Maybe a break will restore me. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Snow shrouds everything around me. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. 
An infinity of ice. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
No watches are allowed here. 
An eternity of winter. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Selective sensory deprivation. I have to keep breathing. 
Half the trees are splintered dead. Why did I agree to do this? Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I've gone 1530 meters now. I long so much for warmth. Is death warmer than here? 
There are no landmarks anywhere. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Everything freezes before my eyes. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
The snow is infinite. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
Every millimeter seems to take hours. 
An eternity of winter. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. The people passing by all look the same. Every element is its own pummeling force.

My legs would ache if I could feel them. Before me is more of the same. Snow shrouds everything around me. Just keep going... 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? There is only one option: keep skiing. How far down can this slope go? Air that annihilates. 
I've gone 1528 meters now. Snow gives way to fetid slush. 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
Wind like encroaching walls. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Gravity controls me completely. Snow shrouds everything around me. Everything freezes before my eyes. Ice encrusting everything in view.

I've gone 1525 meters now. I won't say I'm lost. I can't. An unending expanse produces its own kind of claustrophobia. My peripheral vision is gone. Just tunnel vision forward. Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU

Do I have any skin left to go numb? If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
Wind like encroaching walls. Where have all the people gone? 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. Every element is its own pummeling force. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. 
I've gone 1665 meters now. Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? My body doesn't ache exactly, and yet it feels like it should. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Snow shrouds everything around me. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I'm going 13 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 

THEIR COMPULSION TO SEE IT TO THE END
 
An eternity of winter. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
An infinity of ice. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
Wind like encroaching walls. An all-encompassing sense of chill. How far down can this slope go? 
How far down can this slope go? I have to keep breathing. Just keep going... If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I've gone 1676 meters now. Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. I don't want to be here anymore. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. Everything freezes before my eyes. How far down can this slope go? Selective sensory deprivation. 
No time to shiver. Ice encrusting everything in view. Just keep going... 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. I have to keep breathing. 
The snow is infinite. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
The snow is infinite. Air that annihilates. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. 
No watches are allowed here. 
Gravity controls me completely. 

THE TIME HAS COME
 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I've gone 1687 meters now. Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. Freezing to death suddenly seems so possible. Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. 

THEIR COMPULSION TO SEE IT TO THE END
 
An infinity of ice. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
Snow stinging the eyes. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I'm going 16 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. Before me is more of the same. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Why did I agree to do this? 
How far down can this slope go? A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. Snow shrouds everything around me. A thousand ways to describe the cold. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
The snow is infinite. Everything freezes before my eyes. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
There are no landmarks anywhere. The people passing by all look the same. Why did I agree to do this? Just keep going... 
I've gone 1697 meters now. I long so much for warmth. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. 
A world of nothing but ice. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
The scenery looks like a snowglobe: picturesque, inescapable. 
Why did I agree to do this? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
How far down can this slope go? Snow shrouds everything around me. The people passing by all look the same. 
The snow never ceases. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
No watches are allowed here. 
The scenery blurs into itself. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
An eternity of winter. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I've gone 1708 meters now. The only thing more unsettling than a darkening sky: a sky that never darkens. 
If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. Chill down to the nerve endings. I have to keep breathing. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 
Wind like encroaching walls. No time to shiver.

No time to shiver. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I have to keep breathing. 
I've gone 1718 meters now. It occurs to me that the slope wants me gone. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. I have to keep breathing. Why did I agree to do this? 

THEY ALWAYS FIND THEIR WAY HERE
 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. Before me is more of the same. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I could go faster. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. I have to keep breathing. 
Gravity controls me completely.

Snow like static in the ears. Keep moving. There is no other choice. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. No time to shiver. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
Cold deep in the bones. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I've gone 1730 meters now. I pass something with a foul, unplacable odor. It smothers me, far longer than it should. But when I turn around, I see nothing. Not even a footprint. Just stench. I could die out here. My peripheral vision is gone. Just tunnel vision forward. 

IN THE END THEY'RE ALWAYS DRAWN
 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
Wind like encroaching walls. My legs would ache if I could feel them. Before me is more of the same. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort.

A man whizzes by with impossible, inhuman speed. 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
An eternity of winter. 
Half the trees are splintered dead. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I've gone 1754 meters now. I don't want to be here anymore. The only way out is down. Right? 
An infinity of ice. Keep moving. There is no other choice.

There is only one option: keep skiing. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Before me is more of the same. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
An eternity of winter. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
Cold finds its way into everything. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Colder than cold. No time to shiver. I have to keep breathing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
These people leave no footprints. Nor do the skis. Nothing leaves a mark. There is only one option: keep skiing. Everything freezes before my eyes. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
Just keep going... No time to shiver. The people passing by all look the same. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
A man whizzes by with impossible, inhuman speed. 
One ski in front of the other. Selective sensory deprivation. 
I've gone 1903 meters now. The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
Gravity controls me completely. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. A thousand ways to describe the cold. The people passing by all look the same. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
Half the trees are splintered dead. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Air that annihilates. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Air that annihilates. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
Wind like encroaching walls. Just keep going... How far down can this slope go? Why did I agree to do this? 
No watches are allowed here. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
The snow is infinite. Air that annihilates. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I've gone 1917 meters now. The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. My peripheral vision is gone. Just tunnel vision forward. 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Before me is more of the same. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. My legs would ache if I could feel them. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. The scenery whizzes past, a blur. 

THEY ALWAYS FIND THEIR WAY HERE
 
Where have all the people gone? A thousand ways to describe the cold. Why did I agree to do this? How far down can this slope go? 
One ski in front of the other. The slope will end in time. I have to keep breathing. Before me is more of the same. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
One ski in front of the other. The slope will end in time. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
There are no landmarks anywhere. Air that annihilates. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I've gone 1932 meters now. The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. I could die out here. 

THEIR COMPULSION TO SEE IT TO THE END
 
Where have all the people gone? Everything freezes before my eyes. 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
Airborne, going 26 meters per hour. Every movement airborne feels so impossibly precarious. I have to trust there's flat ground below. I can't look down. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
Gravity controls me completely. 
Wind like encroaching walls. The people passing by all look the same. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
Snow like static in the ears. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
An eternity of winter. How far down can this slope go? 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
Half the trees are splintered dead. 
I've gone 1951 meters now. The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. An unending expanse produces its own kind of claustrophobia. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. A thousand ways to describe the cold. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
Airborne, going 26 meters per hour. Moving on wind and momentum alone. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
Cold deep in the bones. 
Cold deep in the bones. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. The slope will end in time. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
An infinity of ice. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
Cold finds its way into everything. If I close my eyes I'll crash. No time to shiver. 
I've gone 1966 meters now. Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
Just keep going... Ice encrusting everything in view. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. Before me is more of the same. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 

THEY ALWAYS FIND THEIR WAY HERE
 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Why did I agree to do this? I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
The snow never ceases. Air that annihilates. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
Snow that deafens and numbs. The slope will end in time. How far down can this slope go?

Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. Before me is more of the same. 
I've gone 1980 meters now. I can't stop moving. The snow will swallow me, I know. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 
The snow never ceases. How far down can this slope go? No time to shiver. The slope will end in time.

I just hope this will be over quick.

If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. The slope will end in time. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I've gone 1994 meters now. Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. I could die out here. My peripheral vision is gone. Just tunnel vision forward. I no longer remember the sensation of warmth.

An eternity of winter.

Airborne, going 27 meters per hour. I flail through the air, out of control. I have to trust there's flat ground below. I can't look down.

Where have all the people gone? But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Gravity controls me completely. Snow shrouds everything around me. Every element is its own pummeling force. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
The snow never ceases. Air that annihilates. 
Have I been skiing for an hour? Two hours? Two days? It all feels the same. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
Colder than cold. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
How far down can this slope go? Where have all the people gone? Why did I agree to do this? There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I've gone 0 meters now. And meters and meters to go. 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. I have to keep breathing. 

IN THE END THEY'RE ALWAYS DRAWN
 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
The snowfall keeps me down. The slope looks infinite when viewed from the ground. 
An infinity of ice. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Nothing to do but ski and survive. How far down can this slope go? 
How far down can this slope go? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
Everything freezes before my eyes. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
It feels like I've been skiing forever. 

THE TIME HAS COME
 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. Everything freezes before my eyes. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. The people passing by all look the same. 
I've gone 0 meters now. Such a small number, on paper. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
Just keep going... Air that annihilates. I have to keep breathing. 
Gravity controls me completely. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
The slope passes me by. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. A thousand ways to describe the cold. Every element is its own pummeling force. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
Cold finds its way into everything. Just keep going... The slope will end in time. Why did I agree to do this? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. Chill down to the nerve endings. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
How far down can this slope go? If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
Have I been skiing for an hour? Two hours? Two days? It all feels the same. 
The snow is infinite. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
Just keep going... If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
I've gone 0 meters now. And meters and meters to go. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
Half the trees are splintered dead. 
Everything freezes before my eyes. Before me is more of the same. The people passing by all look the same. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
The snowfall keeps me down. I'll get up if I feel ready. 
One ski in front of the other. 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
Snow like static in the ears. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Cold finds its way into everything. Snow shrouds everything around me.

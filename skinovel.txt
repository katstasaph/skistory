I told myself I wasn't going to ski long. 
Or ski far. 
Or ski too fast. 
I don't know how to ski.
 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
I should track how far I've gone. The prudent thing. 
Too much snow to move. I'll get up if I feel ready. Did I really think stopping would help? Gravity wants me moving again. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Guess I'll find out.
 
No watches are allowed here. 
It's too late to turn back now. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
Just need that initial push of momentum. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. The people passing by all look the same. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I've barely moved a millimeter. 
I stare at the forbidding reflection of the ice. Where have all the people gone? If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. I have to push on. 
Just need that initial push of momentum. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. 
I'm going 2 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
It's too late to turn back now. I have to keep breathing. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. How far down can this slope go? 
I can't stay up here forever. A thousand ways to describe the cold. More cold than my body can sustain. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Doubts already.
 
The slope looks nothing like the pictures. 
Nothing looks like what the map said. Where have all the people gone? 
No watches are allowed here. 
Fog hangs in the air. Or something like fog. The people passing by all look the same. 
I had imagined this place more inviting. The people passing by all look the same. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
No one told me how far down this goes. 
Just need that initial push of momentum. There is only one option: keep skiing. The people passing by all look the same. 
There were supposed to be more signposts. 
I'm going 11 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
No use lingering. 
This doesn't feel like skiing. More like a leap of faith. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. They tell you to do that. To ground yourself.
 
I can't stay up here forever. 
Nothing looks like what the map said. An all-encompassing sense of chill. I have to push on. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
It wasn't supposed to look this treacherous. Selective sensory deprivation. 
Fog hangs in the air. Or something like fog. A thousand ways to describe the cold. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. 
I should track how far I've gone. The prudent thing. 
The weather was supposed to be cold. But not this cold. 
I look back for the ski lift that took me here. It's nowhere in sight. I can't even find the rope. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
I stare at the forbidding reflection of the ice. Nothing like a wonderland. 
Just need that initial push of momentum. I have to keep breathing. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Before me is more of the same. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Guess I'll find out.
 
Nothing looks like what the map said. Where have all the people gone? I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
There were supposed to be more people around. Before me is more of the same. More cold than my body can sustain. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
I had imagined this place more inviting. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. The people passing by all look the same. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
None of the other skiers seem to hesitate. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. Why did I agree to do this? 
I've barely moved a millimeter. 
It wasn't supposed to look this treacherous. Air that annihilates. 
The snow looks unnatural up close. Too reflective, maybe. Impenetrable. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
The slope looks nothing like the pictures. My clothes barely protect against this. 
I keep looking back at the starting line, like it's an anchor. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Guess I'll find out.
 
This doesn't feel like skiing. More like a leap of faith. I have to keep breathing. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I look down the slope like you'd look down a cliff edge. Why did I agree to do this? The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
It's too late to turn back now. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
It wasn't supposed to look this treacherous. A thousand ways to describe the cold. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I should track how far I've gone. The prudent thing. 
It's too late to turn back now. 
Nothing looks like what the map said. Everything freezes before my eyes. The slope will end in time. 
I'm going 17 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
There were supposed to be more people around. No time to shiver. Just keep going... 
Nothing looks like what the map said. How far down can this slope go? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Doubts already.
 
I had imagined this place more inviting. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. 
The slope looks nothing like the pictures. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
The slope looks nothing like the pictures. I have to keep breathing. 
The weather was supposed to be cold. But not this cold. 
I've gone 12 meters now. It takes all my energy to hoist my skis upward and go back. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. 
The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. More cold than my body can sustain. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. 
Too cold to think. Every element is its own pummeling force. I have to push on. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. If I ever reach the bottom, maybe I'll ask.
 
Ski slopes generate their own snow when weather forbids. Sometimes, if the sky is clear and you listen closely, you can hear the whir of the generators in the background. Yet the sky is clear, and I hear nothing. Chill down to the nerve endings. If I close my eyes I'll crash. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
Gravity controls me completely. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. All life and warmth leached out of the air. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
Every minute seems to last hours. 
Cold deep in the bones. There is only one option: keep skiing. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. The slope will end in time. 
I never really thought about gravity before. But gravity feels heavier here. It feels like what it is: a force beyond you pressing you into the earth. All life and warmth leached out of the air. 
I've gone 23 meters now. I feel each meter in my aching bones. 
Wind like encroaching walls. My clothes barely protect against this. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
Cold deep in the bones. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Selective sensory deprivation. No time to shiver. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
Cold deep in the bones. 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Air that annihilates. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But out here there's no way to know.
 
The scenery blurs into itself. All life and warmth leached out of the air. Air that annihilates. 
Out of the snow appears a ski lift. Inside are two men. They stare blankly and still. The snow moves more than they do. My clothes barely protect against this. 
It feels like I've been skiing forever. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Just keep going... 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Before me is more of the same. 
I've gone 33 meters now. And meters and meters to go. 
Cold deep in the bones. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
No one told me it would be this quiet. No one told me that when all sounds cease, you hear the snow. You never stop hearing it. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 
Out of the corner of my eye I see something seeping through the ice, an unnatural color. But when I look back it's gone. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. A thousand ways to describe the cold. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
There are ski jumps, of course. They gleam with an artificial, plasticky sheen against the barren snow. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing I have a sense of is passing time.
 
Cold deep in the bones. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Snow stinging the eyes. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
The snow is infinite. 
Snow stinging the eyes. The people passing by all look the same. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I've gone 44 meters now. Such a small number, on paper. 
These people leave no footprints. Nor do the skis. Nothing leaves a mark. 
Snow stinging the eyes. Just keep going... 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I can't sustain top speed out here. 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Ice encrusting everything in view. The people passing by all look the same. 
Why did I agree to do this? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. As if anyone's keeping score.
 
Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. Nothing like a wonderland. 
The landscape is blank. Air that annihilates. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
Cold deep in the bones. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Why did I agree to do this? 
An eternity of winter. Before me is more of the same. 
I've gone 54 meters now. A meaningless number out here. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
Too cold to think. Everything freezes before my eyes. More cold than my body can sustain. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I could go faster. 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
How far down can this slope go? Before me is more of the same. There is only one option: keep skiing. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But out here there's no way to know.
 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. My clothes barely protect against this. Snow shrouds everything around me. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Have I been skiing for an hour? Two hours? Two days? It all feels the same. 
Why did I agree to do this? 
A world of nothing but ice. Why did I agree to do this? Ice encrusting everything in view. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I've gone 66 meters now. Such a small number, on paper. 
Snow like static in the ears. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
Gravity controls me completely. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
The snow is infinite. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
One ski in front of the other. They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But out here there's no way to know.
 
How far down can this slope go? Just keep going... There is only one option: keep skiing. The people passing by all look the same. 
The snow never ceases. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
Every minute seems to last hours. 
Air that annihilates. My clothes barely protect against this. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I've gone 80 meters now. Is that all? 
Gravity controls me completely. The slope will end in time. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. 
All they told me about this slope was that it was free. Free of charge. Free of rules. Or free as in falling. Before me is more of the same. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Air that annihilates. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. There is only one option: keep skiing. Nothing like a wonderland. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. Why did I agree to do this? Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. As if anyone's keeping score.
 
A man whizzes by with impossible, inhuman speed. 
Too cold to think. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. 
A world of nothing but ice. I have to keep breathing. 
I've gone 91 meters now. A meaningless number out here. 
Cold finds its way into everything. My legs would ache if I could feel them. Where have all the people gone? The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
Snow like static in the ears. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I hardly understand the question.
 
I have to push on. The slope will end in time. Ice encrusting everything in view. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Nothing like a wonderland. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
One ski in front of the other. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. My legs would ache if I could feel them. I have to keep breathing. 
I've gone 101 meters now. Or something like that. 
These people leave no footprints. Nor do the skis. Nothing leaves a mark. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
An eternity of winter. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Selective sensory deprivation. The slope will end in time. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 
The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. Selective sensory deprivation. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Colder than cold. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I don't know anymore why I ask.
 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. I have to push on. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
Cold finds its way into everything. The people passing by all look the same.

I'm going 7 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 
The slope was established in 1991, according to a sign. Who did it? What was here before? Was it anything? A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Keep moving. There is no other choice. A thousand ways to describe the cold.

Colder than cold. 
Airborne, going 23 meters per hour. Something out of my control propels me forward and up. The wind's too loud up here. It wants me down. Moving on wind and momentum alone. 
An infinity of ice. No time to shiver. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. My clothes barely protect against this. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Peak skiing performance. Until the next crash.

I ask myself how I'm skiing. The surge of confidence keeps me going. Another meter at least. Small comforts. Until the next crash.
 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Nothing like a wonderland. The people passing by all look the same. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. Every element is its own pummeling force. Just keep going... There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Have I been skiing for an hour? Two hours? Two days? It all feels the same.

I'm going 7 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
The scenery blurs into itself. An all-encompassing sense of chill. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I can still do tricks, it seems.
 
Lift towers jut into the air: attached to nothing, occupied by nothing, anchored by nothing. And yet there are always lifts. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. I have to push on. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Have I been skiing for an hour? Two hours? Two days? It all feels the same.

The scenery blurs into itself.

Each breath takes more effort than the last. I have to push on. How far down can this slope go? 
Cold finds its way into everything. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I've gone 237 meters now. A meaningless number out here. 
These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
Too cold to think. Just keep going... No time to shiver.

The reward for braving snow is more snow. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Somehow I'm still intact. Small comforts.
 
The snow never ceases. Selective sensory deprivation. Why did I agree to do this? 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
Everything freezes before my eyes. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. I have to keep breathing. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Before me is more of the same. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack.

I ask myself how I'm skiing. The surge of confidence keeps me going. Another meter at least. Small comforts.
 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. Snow shrouds everything around me. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion.

I've gone 514 meters now. A meaningless number out here.

There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Gravity controls me completely. 
I'm going 16 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. Nothing like a wonderland. 
I have to push on. Ice encrusting everything in view. The slope will end in time. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I can still do tricks, it seems. Somehow I'm still intact.
 
All life and warmth leached out of the air. 
Cold finds its way into everything. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. The slope will end in time. 
It feels like I've been skiing forever.

Why did I agree to do this?

The reward for braving snow is more snow. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere.

Cold deep in the bones. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
How far down can this slope go? My legs would ache if I could feel them. I have to push on. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
Just keep going... Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I've gone 775 meters now. I feel each meter in my aching bones.

An infinity of ice. I have to keep breathing. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform.

It feels like I've been skiing forever. 
Just keep going... 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I've gone 967 meters now. Is that all? 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Ice encrusting everything in view. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Snow stinging the eyes. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Before me is more of the same. They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 
These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. Everything freezes before my eyes. Nothing like a wonderland. I have to keep breathing. 
The snow is infinite. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Everything freezes before my eyes. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Peak skiing performance. I have to find comfort in this.
 
Snow that deafens and numbs. 
The trees must be moving. I have to push on. 
Every minute seems to last hours. 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. Everything freezes before my eyes. Why did I agree to do this? 
Snow that deafens and numbs. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I've gone 978 meters now. And meters and meters to go. 
An infinity of ice. Nothing like a wonderland. More cold than my body can sustain. The slope will end in time. 
The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. A thousand ways to describe the cold. The people passing by all look the same. 
I'm going 9 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
How far down can this slope go? 
Snow that deafens and numbs. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. Before me is more of the same. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Peak skiing performance. I have to find comfort in this.
 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. The slope will end in time. 
An eternity of winter. My legs would ache if I could feel them. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Everything freezes before my eyes. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. The slope will end in time. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I've gone 980 meters now. And meters and meters to go. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. No time to shiver. Before me is more of the same. 
I have to push on. There is only one option: keep skiing. A thousand ways to describe the cold. No time to shiver. 
I pause to catch my breath. But it remains the same. It's too steep to stay put forever. 
Selective sensory deprivation. 
These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The surge of confidence keeps me going. Another meter at least.
 
How far down can this slope go? Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. Air that annihilates. 
Every minute seems to last hours. 
Snow like static in the ears. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
Everything freezes before my eyes. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Ice encrusting everything in view. I have to push on. 
I've gone 980 meters now. Is that all? 
Just keep going... 
The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. 
I'm downed. I've got no control over my body. 
Snow stinging the eyes. Where have all the people gone? How far down can this slope go? 
The scenery blurs into itself. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Practically a professional. I have to find comfort in this. Somehow I'm still intact.
 
The landscape is blank. 
A world of nothing but ice. There is only one option: keep skiing. Why did I agree to do this? Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
One ski in front of the other. 
I've gone 982 meters now. Is that all? 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. All life and warmth leached out of the air. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. How far down can this slope go? 
I'm going 9 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
The snow never ceases. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. Nothing like a wonderland. 
I have to keep breathing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I can still do tricks, it seems. Small comforts.

Snow shrouds everything around me. All life and warmth leached out of the air. Every element is its own pummeling force. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
Have I been skiing for an hour? Two hours? Two days? It all feels the same. 
The snow never ceases. 
Snow like static in the ears. Chill down to the nerve endings. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I've gone 987 meters now. I feel each meter in my aching bones. 
Cold deep in the bones. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
Cold deep in the bones. Before me is more of the same. All life and warmth leached out of the air. Just keep going... 
If I don't start moving the snowfall might trap me here. It's too steep to stay put forever. Did I really think stopping would help? 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
An infinity of ice. Selective sensory deprivation. Snow shrouds everything around me. I ski on autopilot, outside myself.

Snow stinging the eyes. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I've gone 987 meters now. Such a small number, on paper. 
Just keep going... A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. 
I'm downed. Despite myself, I yelp. I hear the words escape my lips. But I hear nothing. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. My legs would ache if I could feel them. I have to keep breathing. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
Gravity controls me completely. Everything freezes before my eyes. Where have all the people gone? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Peak skiing performance. Until the next crash. I have to find comfort in this.
 
An infinity of ice. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere.

If I close my eyes I'll crash. Where have all the people gone? The people passing by all look the same. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I've gone 987 meters now. A meaningless number out here. 
How far down can this slope go? Ice encrusting everything in view. Just keep going... 
Snow that deafens and numbs. Ice encrusting everything in view. All life and warmth leached out of the air. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
Too much snow to move. I'll get up if I feel ready. It's too steep to stay put forever. 
Too cold to think. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Practically a professional. I have to find comfort in this. Until the next crash.

I've gone 987 meters now. I feel each meter in my aching bones. 
Too cold to think. My clothes barely protect against this. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
An infinity of ice. They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
If I don't start moving the snowfall might trap me here.

Gravity controls me completely. Everything freezes before my eyes. My clothes barely protect against this. 
I've gone 987 meters now. And meters and meters to go. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? Before me is more of the same. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I remain still as the slope passes me by. I'll get up if I feel ready. Did I really think stopping would help? 
Where have all the people gone? Air that annihilates. 
Snow shrouds everything around me.

The reward for braving snow is more snow. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
I don't remember when I started holding my breath. Something is holding it for me. How far down can this slope go? 
Cold finds its way into everything. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. My clothes barely protect against this. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I can still do tricks, it seems. I have to find comfort in this. Small comforts.

The trick is to never let yourself stop. Keep moving. There is no other choice. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. The people passing by all look the same. 
I've gone 1040 meters now. Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. I shouldn't have come. It all feels wrong. I learned once the conditions under which a human could freeze to death. Some things you don't forget. 
I pass something with a foul, unplacable odor. It smothers me, far longer than it should. But when I turn around, I see nothing. Not even a footprint. Just stench. 
The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I'm going 16 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
The farther I go, the quieter it gets. 
Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. Selective sensory deprivation. Where have all the people gone? These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. 
Have I been skiing for an hour? Two hours? Two days? It all feels the same. 
Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
The farther I go, the quieter it gets. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. 
I've gone 1040 meters now. A man topples over and falls fast. Something in his movement unsettles me, but before I can place it he's there and gone. 
The air sends spines to my face. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I don't want to be here anymore. 
I'm going 16 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 
I shouldn't have come. All life and warmth leached out of the air. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Ice encrusting everything in view. More cold than my body can sustain. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
Snowdrifts start to look like chasms. There is only one option: keep skiing. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
Footprints, but not in a pattern. Where have all the people gone? These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. I have to keep breathing. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
I long so much for warmth. 
Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. Air that annihilates. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I've gone 1045 meters now. There are scents now, each more acrid than the last. 
Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. 
I shouldn't have come. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I stop. Just for a while. Did I really think stopping would help? 
The farther I go, the quieter it gets. More cold than my body can sustain. All life and warmth leached out of the air. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. 
I wore bright clothes to stand out against the ice. That's what they told me to do. I shouldn't have listened. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. 
Snow gives way to fetid slush. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
Snow gives way to fetid slush. They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. Nothing like a wonderland. 
I won't say I'm lost. I can't. 
I've gone 1045 meters now. A hell of ice. The landscape is atrophying, and so am I. 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. More cold than my body can sustain. 
Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
Crashed. Despite myself, I yelp. I hear the words escape my lips. But I hear nothing. The crash doesn't hurt exactly. It's more that I know it should. Another skier whizzes by my downed body. He doesn't even notice. 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. Selective sensory deprivation. 
Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Footprints, but not in a pattern. I have to push on. The people passing by all look the same. I have to keep breathing. 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. I have to push on. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. More cold than my body can sustain. Before me is more of the same.

I'm going 7 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. 
There are scents now, each more acrid than the last. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. The slope will end in time. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.

A wasteland of ice now. I have to push on. I have to keep breathing. Every element is its own pummeling force.

NO ESCAPE NO ESCAPE
 
A wasteland of ice now. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. There is only one option: keep skiing. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
The farther I go, the quieter it gets. 
I've gone 1055 meters now. The footprints don't look like footprints anymore. They look like trails. Like being dragged and leaving marks. 
The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. 
Footprints, but not in a pattern. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
A wasteland of ice now. If I close my eyes I'll crash. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze.

I've gone 1059 meters now. The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. I long so much for warmth. 
It occurs to me that the slope wants me gone. Snow shrouds everything around me. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? There is only one option: keep skiing. Ice encrusting everything in view.

Footprints, but not in a pattern. 
I feel my skin go numb, unresponsive. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
Crashed. Face meets snow. Another skier whizzes by my downed body. He doesn't even notice. Every time I fall I fear it's the last. Have to get my bearings. Can't get them. 
I won't say I'm lost. I can't. No time to shiver. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're slowly strangling me. Just keep going... An all-encompassing sense of chill. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
I shouldn't have come. 
A bush is burning. Don't think about it. A thousand ways to describe the cold. The slope will end in time.

Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. 
The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. 
I'm going 14 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort.

IN THE END THEY'RE ALWAYS DRAWN
 
The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. I have to keep breathing. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
A hell of ice. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. More cold than my body can sustain. The people passing by all look the same. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. How far down can this slope go? More cold than my body can sustain. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. Selective sensory deprivation. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. 
I've gone 1085 meters now. Snow gives way to fetid slush. My peripheral vision is gone. Just tunnel vision forward.

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. If I close my eyes I'll crash. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Snow gives way to fetid slush. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Nothing like a wonderland. 
The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I've gone 1096 meters now. The air sends spines to my face. 
A hell of ice. 
Snow gives way to fetid slush. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 
The air sends spines to my face. Why did I agree to do this? They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. 
The air around me sounds like it's hissing. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. Ice encrusting everything in view. The slope will end in time. Nothing like a wonderland. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
I long so much for warmth. The people passing by all look the same. I have to keep breathing. 
Footprints, but not in a pattern. 
I've gone 1108 meters now. It occurs to me that the slope wants me gone. Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. I long so much for warmth. 
A wasteland of ice now. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
Snowdrifts start to look like chasms. There is only one option: keep skiing. All life and warmth leached out of the air. I have to push on. 
Airborne, going 24 meters per hour. Somehow the presence of ski jumps is reassuring. The slope looks far too vast beneath me. I feel myself moving faster while airborne. Is that good? The slope looks far too vast beneath me. 
Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Nothing to do but ski and survive. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. 
The farther I go, the quieter it gets. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Air that annihilates. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
The only thing more unsettling than a darkening sky: a sky that never darkens. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. I have to push on. How far down can this slope go? 
No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. There is only one option: keep skiing. Before me is more of the same. I have to keep breathing. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
A hell of ice. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. The slope will end in time. 

WE KNOW YOU BY YOUR SCENT
 
I don't want to be here anymore. Just keep going... My clothes barely protect against this. 
I've gone 1124 meters now. I long so much for warmth. 
The only thing more unsettling than a darkening sky: a sky that never darkens. All life and warmth leached out of the air. 
I shouldn't have come. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I'm going 17 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
Snow gives way to fetid slush. How far down can this slope go? 
I feel my skin go numb, unresponsive. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I long so much for warmth. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. 
The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. 
I've gone 1135 meters now. My body is stinging. Frostbite? Or something else? Skiing to my self-destruction. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. I don't want to be here anymore. 
The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. The slope will end in time. My clothes barely protect against this. 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. Nothing like a wonderland. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. Chill down to the nerve endings. My clothes barely protect against this.

Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. 
I've gone 1142 meters now. Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. I try to remember the outside world. I remember nothing. If anything happened to me, the snow would bury any trace. 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I don't want to be here anymore. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 
The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.

I've gone 1148 meters now. I don't want to be here anymore. Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. I become acutely aware of every new gradient of cold. Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. 
A hell of ice. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
I feel my skin go numb, unresponsive.

A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
There are scents now, each more acrid than the last. 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. 
I've gone 1153 meters now. The farther I go, the quieter it gets. 
I shouldn't have come. The people passing by all look the same. 
Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. If I go faster I might crash.

I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. My clothes barely protect against this. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
A bush is burning. Don't think about it. 
Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. How far down can this slope go? 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
Every tree I pass looks battered, gangrenous. Snow shrouds everything around me. The slope will end in time. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH

I've gone 1169 meters now. The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. An unending expanse produces its own kind of claustrophobia. Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. I feel my skin go numb, unresponsive. 

NO ESCAPE NO ESCAPE
 
I shouldn't have come. More cold than my body can sustain. A thousand ways to describe the cold.

The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. 
I can't stop moving. The snow will swallow me, I know. Snow shrouds everything around me. An all-encompassing sense of chill. All life and warmth leached out of the air. 
No watches are allowed here. 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. Ice encrusting everything in view. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. 
I feel my skin go numb, unresponsive. 
I've gone 1287 meters now. Footprints, but not in a pattern. Every tree I pass looks battered, gangrenous. I could die out here. My body is stinging. Frostbite? Or something else? 
I shouldn't have come. The people passing by all look the same. I have to push on. Just keep going... 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. More cold than my body can sustain. The people passing by all look the same. 
Too much snow to move. Gravity wants me moving again. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
Every tree I pass looks battered, gangrenous. Selective sensory deprivation. 
Snowdrifts start to look like chasms. Air that annihilates. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
Snow gives way to fetid slush. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. 
I can't stop moving. The snow will swallow me, I know. Selective sensory deprivation. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. If I close my eyes I'll crash. Nothing like a wonderland. 
Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. 
I've gone 1289 meters now. Footprints, but not in a pattern. Every tree I pass looks battered, gangrenous. Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. The only way out is down. Right? 
Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
The farther I go, the quieter it gets. 
I'm going 6 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
The farther I go, the quieter it gets. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
The air sends spines to my face. Snow shrouds everything around me. Selective sensory deprivation. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
The air around me sounds like it's hissing. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Everything freezes before my eyes. I have to keep breathing. 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? Before me is more of the same. My clothes barely protect against this. 
I've gone 1296 meters now. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. Is death warmer than here? Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. My body doesn't ache exactly, and yet it feels like it should. 
A wasteland of ice now. 
I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're slowly strangling me. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. I have to push on. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. There is only one option: keep skiing. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
My body is stinging. Frostbite? Or something else? The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
I long so much for warmth. 
The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
There are scents now, each more acrid than the last. Why did I agree to do this? An all-encompassing sense of chill. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
I've gone 1303 meters now. Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. The air sends spines to my face. 
The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. Just keep going...

I'm going 7 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
My body is stinging. Frostbite? Or something else? 
The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
I long so much for warmth. 
Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. Where have all the people gone? Just keep going...

I shouldn't have come. Just keep going... Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. 
I've gone 1308 meters now. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. My peripheral vision is gone. Just tunnel vision forward. 
A bush is burning. Don't think about it. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. Selective sensory deprivation. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION

I'm going 7 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right.

My body is stinging. Frostbite? Or something else? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
The air sends spines to my face. 
The air sends spines to my face.

The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I've gone 1330 meters now. Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. Before me is more of the same. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight.

I'm going 7 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
A wasteland of ice now. 
Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. I have to keep breathing. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. Air that annihilates. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
Snowdrifts start to look like chasms. 
The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. 
I've gone 1501 meters now. Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. I long so much for warmth. 
Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. Before me is more of the same. 
The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. Everything freezes before my eyes. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
A hell of ice. Ice encrusting everything in view. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
There are scents now, each more acrid than the last. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Chill down to the nerve endings. How far down can this slope go? 
Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Chill down to the nerve endings. More cold than my body can sustain. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. No time to shiver. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. All life and warmth leached out of the air. Nothing like a wonderland. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I've gone 1506 meters now. The farther I go, the quieter it gets. An unending expanse produces its own kind of claustrophobia. Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. 
No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. There is only one option: keep skiing. I have to push on. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I can't stop moving. The snow will swallow me, I know. Before me is more of the same. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. If I go faster I might crash. 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. 
Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. 
The air sends spines to my face. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
Snow gives way to fetid slush. 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. The people passing by all look the same. Selective sensory deprivation. 
I've gone 1512 meters now. Every tree I pass looks battered, gangrenous. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. I become acutely aware of every new gradient of cold. 
A wasteland of ice now. Before me is more of the same. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. Endless slope in this direction too. 
No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.

Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Chill down to the nerve endings. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. I ski at a slant, not fully downhill. 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. A thousand ways to describe the cold. My clothes barely protect against this.

I won't say I'm lost. I can't. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I'm going 8 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. 
The air sends spines to my face. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. Air that annihilates. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. No time to shiver.

I've gone 1529 meters now. The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. Is death warmer than here? Freezing to death suddenly seems so possible. I don't want to be here anymore. 
No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
Snow gives way to fetid slush. The slope will end in time. Just keep going... 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
I don't want to be here anymore. 
A hell of ice. Nothing like a wonderland. Before me is more of the same. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
I feel my skin go numb, unresponsive. No time to shiver. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. My legs would ache if I could feel them.

I long so much for warmth. Ice encrusting everything in view. 

WE HAVE NO ENDING
 
I don't want to be here anymore. A thousand ways to describe the cold. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. Where have all the people gone? No time to shiver. 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. My clothes barely protect against this.

I'm going 21 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. 
A wasteland of ice now. Where have all the people gone? I have to push on. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
My body is stinging. Frostbite? Or something else? Nothing to do but ski and survive. How far down can this slope go? Chill down to the nerve endings. 
A wasteland of ice now. Keep moving. There is no other choice. They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
Footprints, but not in a pattern. 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. My clothes barely protect against this. Everything freezes before my eyes. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I've gone 1716 meters now. The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. An unending expanse produces its own kind of claustrophobia. My body doesn't ache exactly, and yet it feels like it should. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Where have all the people gone? Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I'm going 18 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. 
A wasteland of ice now. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
There are scents now, each more acrid than the last. 
A wasteland of ice now. 
No watches are allowed here. 
The farther I go, the quieter it gets. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. I have to push on. No time to shiver. My clothes barely protect against this. 
I've gone 1727 meters now. Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. My peripheral vision is gone. Just tunnel vision forward. 
Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. The people passing by all look the same. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
I won't say I'm lost. I can't. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 
A wasteland of ice now. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
It occurs to me that the slope wants me gone. There is only one option: keep skiing. Selective sensory deprivation. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
Snow gives way to fetid slush. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. Where have all the people gone? More cold than my body can sustain. 

IN THE END THEY'RE ALWAYS DRAWN
 
The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Where have all the people gone? 
I've gone 1737 meters now. Snowdrifts start to look like chasms. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. My body doesn't ache exactly, and yet it feels like it should.

Still no end in sight. Nothing. Before me is more of the same. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
No watches are allowed here. 
Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. An all-encompassing sense of chill. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I long so much for warmth. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. 
I've gone 1740 meters now. The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. The air sends spines to my face. 
I shouldn't have come. 
I shouldn't have come. Why did I agree to do this? Nothing like a wonderland. 
I'm going 9 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. There is only one option: keep skiing. The people passing by all look the same. Before me is more of the same.

I won't say I'm lost. I can't. 
A bush is burning. Don't think about it. I have to push on. 
I've gone 1740 meters now. Snow gives way to fetid slush. 
I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're slowly strangling me. Everything freezes before my eyes. Ice encrusting everything in view. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. 
I'm downed. I don't see what hit me until it's too late. Every time I fall I fear it's the last. The crash doesn't hurt exactly. It's more that I know it should. 
The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. More cold than my body can sustain. Every element is its own pummeling force. Selective sensory deprivation.

Snowdrifts arranged like open graves.

I'm going 14 meters per hour. I move in a winding path.

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
I shouldn't have come. 
No watches are allowed here. 
No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. 
I've gone 1759 meters now. I don't want to be here anymore. 
Still no end in sight. Nothing.

I stop. Just for a while. Did I really think stopping would help? It's too steep to stay put forever. Did I really think stopping would help? 

NO ESCAPE NO ESCAPE
 
Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn.

Every tree I pass looks battered, gangrenous. 
Airborne, going 29 meters per hour. Something out of my control propels me forward and up. I have to trust there's flat ground below. I can't look down. Moving on wind and momentum alone. 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. Where have all the people gone? I have to keep breathing. How far down can this slope go? 

IN THE END THEY'RE ALWAYS DRAWN
 
Snow gives way to fetid slush. Why did I agree to do this? Before me is more of the same. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
Footprints, but not in a pattern. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Every tree I pass looks battered, gangrenous. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
I long so much for warmth. 
Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. The people passing by all look the same. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I've gone 1890 meters now. The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. I become acutely aware of every new gradient of cold. 
The air around me sounds like it's hissing. 
The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
I won't say I'm lost. I can't. 
The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. The people passing by all look the same. Where have all the people gone? 

NO ESCAPE NO ESCAPE
 
No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. All life and warmth leached out of the air. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. 
Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I've gone 1898 meters now. I long so much for warmth. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
I long so much for warmth. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. Every element is its own pummeling force. 

THE TIME HAS COME
 
Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. All life and warmth leached out of the air. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
I don't want to be here anymore. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
The farther I go, the quieter it gets. Air that annihilates. How far down can this slope go? Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. Ice encrusting everything in view. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 

WE KNOW YOU BY YOUR SCENT
 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. Air that annihilates. 
I don't want to be here anymore. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Ice encrusting everything in view. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I've gone 1903 meters now. The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. If anything happened to me, the snow would bury any trace. Every tree I pass looks battered, gangrenous. 
Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. Where have all the people gone? 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
My body is stinging. Frostbite? Or something else? The slope will end in time. More cold than my body can sustain. 
My body is stinging. Frostbite? Or something else? Selective sensory deprivation. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.

The farther I go, the quieter it gets. 
Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. Selective sensory deprivation. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
I feel my skin go numb, unresponsive. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform.

I've gone 1908 meters now. The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. Snow gives way to fetid slush. The landscape is atrophying, and so am I. I could die out here. 
A wasteland of ice now. 
Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. Endless slope in this direction too. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
I feel my skin go numb, unresponsive. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
The farther I go, the quieter it gets. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.

Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. All life and warmth leached out of the air. Every element is its own pummeling force. My clothes barely protect against this. 
I've gone 1916 meters now. I don't want to be here anymore. I become acutely aware of every new gradient of cold. The landscape is atrophying, and so am I. 
I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're slowly strangling me. A thousand ways to describe the cold. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
A wasteland of ice now. Chill down to the nerve endings. All life and warmth leached out of the air. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
I'm going 17 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
A hell of ice. 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. Air that annihilates. Just keep going... A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. The farther I go, the steeper it looks.

I won't say I'm lost. I can't. 
I've gone 1930 meters now. The air sends spines to my face. It all feels wrong. 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. The people passing by all look the same. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Everything freezes before my eyes. Air that annihilates. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. Every element is its own pummeling force. They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall.

Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? 
I've gone 1971 meters now. Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? An unending expanse produces its own kind of claustrophobia. I'll never ski again. Freezing to death suddenly seems so possible.

I'm going 15 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
I shouldn't have come. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Just keep going... 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. Nothing like a wonderland. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. 
Every minute seems to last hours. 
Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
Every tree I pass looks battered, gangrenous. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I've gone too far. Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. Breathe and ski and breathe and ski. 
The air around me sounds like it's hissing. They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
There are scents now, each more acrid than the last. No time to shiver. Where have all the people gone? Air that annihilates. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
I long so much for warmth. I have to push on. My legs would ache if I could feel them. Nothing like a wonderland. 
The farther I go, the quieter it gets. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
The air sends spines to my face. No time to shiver. Selective sensory deprivation. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I feel my skin go numb, unresponsive. Where have all the people gone? I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
The farther I go, the quieter it gets. 
The farther I go, the quieter it gets. 
I've gone too far. Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. too far too far too far 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? 

WE KNOW YOU BY YOUR SCENT
 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I could go faster. 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. Ice encrusting everything in view. Air that annihilates. 
I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. 
Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
I won't say I'm lost. I can't. I have to keep breathing. 
Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. My legs would ache if I could feel them. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
I've gone too far. No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. too far too far too far too far too far 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
I won't say I'm lost. I can't. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. 
I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're slowly strangling me. They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. My legs would ache if I could feel them. No time to shiver. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. 
A bush is burning. Don't think about it. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? Nothing to do but ski and survive. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
Every minute seems to last hours. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
I don't want to be here anymore. Just keep going... A thousand ways to describe the cold. Air that annihilates. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
I long so much for warmth. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I've gone too far. Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? Outski them. Fast. Go. 
Snow gives way to fetid slush. More cold than my body can sustain. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. All life and warmth leached out of the air. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. The people passing by all look the same. 
My body is stinging. Frostbite? Or something else? Snow shrouds everything around me. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. 
The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. My clothes barely protect against this. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
A wasteland of ice now. 

THE TIME HAS COME
 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I've gone too far. The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. run away run away run away run away 

WE KNOW YOU BY YOUR SCENT
 
Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. How far down can this slope go? The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I long so much for warmth. Just keep going... My clothes barely protect against this. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
My body is stinging. Frostbite? Or something else? 
The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. 
Snow gives way to fetid slush. No time to shiver. 
Have I been skiing for an hour? Two hours? Two days? It all feels the same. 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. I have to push on. Selective sensory deprivation. 
I long so much for warmth. 
I've gone too far. The farther I go, the quieter it gets. Don't think just ski don't think just ski. 
The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. How far down can this slope go? All life and warmth leached out of the air. 

THEIR COMPULSION TO SEE IT TO THE END
 
I don't want to be here anymore. 
I'm going 13 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 
Still no end in sight. Nothing. Helpless against the onslaught of the elements. 
The farther I go, the quieter it gets. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
A wasteland of ice now. My legs would ache if I could feel them. More cold than my body can sustain. 
The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. 
I won't say I'm lost. I can't. Nothing like a wonderland. My legs would ache if I could feel them. They promised free skiing. What it feels like is freefall. 
I've gone too far. I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're slowly strangling me. I'm surrounded. Have to keep skiing.

I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
Snowdrifts start to look like chasms. 
Footprints, but not in a pattern. Before me is more of the same. Air that annihilates. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
I can't stop moving. The snow will swallow me, I know. I have to keep breathing. 
I shouldn't have come. 
I've gone too far. Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. I'm surrounded. Have to keep skiing. 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Selective sensory deprivation. 
It occurs to me that the slope wants me gone. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. My clothes barely protect against this. The air feels unnaturally heavy upon me.

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU

Footprints, but not in a pattern. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I've gone too far. No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. Nowhere to hide. 
I long so much for warmth. How far down can this slope go? My clothes barely protect against this. All life and warmth leached out of the air. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. How far down can this slope go? 
I pause to catch my breath. But it remains the same. Gravity wants me moving again. If I don't start moving the snowfall might trap me here. The slope looks infinite when viewed from the ground.

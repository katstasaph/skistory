I told myself I wasn't going to ski long. 
Or ski far. 
Or ski too fast. 
I don't know how to ski.
 
No watches are allowed here. 
I've gone 0 meters now. Such a small number, on paper. 
I pause to catch my breath. But it remains the same. Did I really think stopping would help? I'll get up if I feel ready. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I don't know anymore why I ask.
 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
No one told me it would be this quiet. No one told me that when all sounds cease, you hear the snow. You never stop hearing it. Chill down to the nerve endings. Nothing like a wonderland. 
I don't remember when I started holding my breath. Something is holding it for me. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
I've gone 0 meters now. I feel each meter in my aching bones. 
A woman crashes and stays crashed. Every moment the same grimace, the same contortion of skis and poles and body. I watch her as long as I can. The slope will end in time. 
I never really thought about gravity before. But gravity feels heavier here. It feels like what it is: a force beyond you pressing you into the earth. 
I'm going 1 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
A finger goes numb. Then another. The numbness creeps up my arm and further down my body, in a strange pattern I can't quite place. There is only one option: keep skiing. More cold than my body can sustain. The slope will end in time. 
Snow like static in the ears. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. As if anyone's keeping score.
 
The snow never ceases. 
Everything freezes before my eyes. Selective sensory deprivation. The people passing by all look the same. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
Colder than cold. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. Ice encrusting everything in view. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. I have to keep breathing. 
I've gone 1 meters now. Such a small number, on paper. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
Just keep going... A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
I'm going 10 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
Ski slopes generate their own snow when weather forbids. Sometimes, if the sky is clear and you listen closely, you can hear the whir of the generators in the background. Yet the sky is clear, and I hear nothing. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. All life and warmth leached out of the air. 
These people leave no footprints. Nor do the skis. Nothing leaves a mark. Nothing like a wonderland. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. How far down can this slope go? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But out here there's no way to know.
 
One ski in front of the other. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. 
No watches are allowed here. 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. More cold than my body can sustain. Nothing like a wonderland. The slope will end in time. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
I've gone 11 meters now. I feel each meter in my aching bones. 
The snow is infinite. How far down can this slope go? Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
No time to shiver. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I'm going 19 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. 
Colder than cold. Selective sensory deprivation. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I don't know anymore why I ask.
 
The snow never ceases. The people passing by all look the same. More cold than my body can sustain. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. Before me is more of the same. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
The snow is infinite. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Where have all the people gone? 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. Why did I agree to do this? I have to keep breathing. 
I've gone 25 meters now. I feel each meter in my aching bones. 
Colder than cold. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
Snow stinging the eyes. Air that annihilates. 
A world of nothing but ice. Every element is its own pummeling force. The slope will end in time. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing I have a sense of is passing time.
 
Half the trees are splintered dead. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. I have to keep breathing. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
Snow stinging the eyes. Chill down to the nerve endings. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
Cold finds its way into everything. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I've gone 36 meters now. I feel each meter in my aching bones. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
The snow is infinite. 
I'm going 16 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. If I close my eyes I'll crash. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I don't know anymore why I ask.
 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Cold deep in the bones. Air that annihilates. Just keep going... 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I've gone 991 meters now. Turning back like this is pointless. 
Snow stinging the eyes. 
A sign tells me how to gain better control. But I don't understand what it's telling me. The slope will end in time. There is only one option: keep skiing. Air that annihilates. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Cold finds its way into everything. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. If I ever reach the bottom, maybe I'll ask.
 
Cold finds its way into everything. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
There are ski jumps, of course. They gleam with an artificial, plasticky sheen against the barren snow. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
Every minute seems to last hours. 
One ski in front of the other. 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. Every element is its own pummeling force. Everything freezes before my eyes. I have to keep breathing. 
I've gone 977 meters now. And meters and meters to go. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 
Colder than cold. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Nothing like a wonderland. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
Just keep going... 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I don't know anymore why I ask.
 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
The scenery blurs into itself. 
An eternity of winter. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
I've gone 965 meters now. I feel each meter in my aching bones. 
An eternity of winter. Just keep going... 
Colder than cold. The slope will end in time. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing I have a sense of is passing time.
 
All life and warmth leached out of the air. I have to keep breathing. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. 
Have I been skiing for an hour? Two hours? Two days? It all feels the same. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. My clothes barely protect me. If I close my eyes I'll crash. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I've gone 959 meters now. Or something like that.

I ask myself how I'm skiing. The thought makes me wince. But I'm still moving. Survive first. Excel later.
 
The scenery looks like a snowglobe: picturesque, inescapable. More cold than my body can sustain. Just keep going... 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? More cold than my body can sustain. Nothing to do but ski and survive. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
It feels like I've been skiing forever. 
Just keep going... Before me is more of the same. 
A world of nothing but ice. The slope will end in time. A thousand ways to describe the cold. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I've gone 959 meters now. Or something like that. 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. No time to shiver. Selective sensory deprivation. 
Where have all the people gone? 
Crashed. Every crash makes me weaker. Another skier whizzes by my downed body. He doesn't even notice. Every time I fall I fear it's the last. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. The people passing by all look the same. My clothes barely protect me. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
The scenery blurs into itself. Just keep going... Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere.

The trick is to never let yourself stop. The slope will end in time. 
The slope is less and less uniform the farther I go. Rougher, darker snow. Dead branches everywhere. Icicles beneath the snow like fangs. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. Selective sensory deprivation. Just keep going... 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
Colder than cold. An all-encompassing sense of chill.

The trick is to never let yourself stop. My clothes barely protect me. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
Gravity controls me completely. 
I've collapsed. I lie motionless, half-frozen. Another skier whizzes by my downed body. He doesn't even notice. Every time I fall I fear it's the last. Every crash makes me weaker. 
Wind like encroaching walls. Just keep going... 
An infinity of ice. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The thought makes me wince. But I'm still moving. Crashes are normal and to be expected. So I was told. I can't dwell on skill. I have to keep skiing.

Half the trees are splintered dead. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. No time to shiver. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
Something moving underneath the snowbanks. Some sort of protuberance, something from deep below. I can't look back. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion.

Colder than cold.

The trick is to never let yourself stop. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Cold deep in the bones. 
I've gone 483 meters now. And meters and meters to go. 
How far down can this slope go? More cold than my body can sustain. 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. I ski at a slant, not fully downhill. 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Wind like encroaching walls. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I can still do tricks, it seems.
 
Gravity controls me completely. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
Cold finds its way into everything. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
Snow stinging the eyes. 
Just keep going... 
I've gone 476 meters now. Is that all? 
How far down can this slope go? I ski on autopilot, outside myself. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
The snow never ceases. 
I'm going 16 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
Chill down to the nerve endings. I have to keep breathing. My clothes barely protect me. 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. Snow shrouds everything around me. Air that annihilates. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Practically a professional. Until the next crash.
 
A world of nothing but ice. Why did I agree to do this? 
How far down can this slope go? Just keep going... Chill down to the nerve endings. Selective sensory deprivation. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
The snow is infinite. 
An eternity of winter. 
I've gone 463 meters now. Is that all? 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Why did I agree to do this? 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
Airborne, going 25 meters per hour. Every movement airborne feels so impossibly precarious. Moving on wind and momentum alone. I feel myself moving faster while airborne. Is that good? 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. Everything freezes before my eyes. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. More cold than my body can sustain. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Practically a professional. Small comforts.
 
These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. How far down can this slope go? My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. Before me is more of the same. A thousand ways to describe the cold. Before me is more of the same.

The scenery blurs into itself. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Snow shrouds everything around me. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
The scenery blurs into itself. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I can still do tricks, it seems.
 
Cold deep in the bones. 
I have to keep breathing. The people passing by all look the same. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Everything freezes before my eyes. Where have all the people gone? 
A world of nothing but ice. Air that annihilates.

Cold deep in the bones. More cold than my body can sustain. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
No time to shiver. I have to keep breathing. My clothes barely protect me.

I don't remember when I started holding my breath. Something is holding it for me. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. As fast as my bones allow. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. There is only one option: keep skiing. Where have all the people gone? Nothing like a wonderland.

Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. I have to keep breathing. Every element is its own pummeling force. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
Snow like static in the ears. Why did I agree to do this? Snow shrouds everything around me. How far down can this slope go? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Practically a professional. Until the next crash. I have to find comfort in this.
 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. Ice encrusting everything in view.

I've gone 119 meters now. I feel each meter in my aching bones. 
The trees must be moving. 
A world of nothing but ice. 
Airborne, going 29 meters per hour. Moving on wind and momentum alone. The wind's too loud up here. It wants me down. 
The scenery looks like a snowglobe: picturesque, inescapable. Selective sensory deprivation. 
An infinity of ice. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. The people passing by all look the same. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Born for it. Somehow I'm still intact. Until the next crash.
 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. Everything freezes before my eyes. The people passing by all look the same. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Every minute seems to last hours. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. Where have all the people gone? An all-encompassing sense of chill. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. 
I've gone 116 meters now. Or something like that. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. My legs would ache if I could feel them. If I close my eyes I'll crash. An all-encompassing sense of chill.

Colder than cold. Just keep going... Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I'm downed. Face meets snow. Every crash makes me weaker. Every time I fall I fear it's the last. The crash doesn't hurt exactly. It's more that I know it should. 
Cold finds its way into everything. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Born for it.

Cold deep in the bones. 
Just keep going... 
I've collapsed. I've got no control over my body. Another skier whizzes by my downed body. He doesn't even notice. Every time I fall I fear it's the last. 
Half the trees are splintered dead. 
One ski in front of the other. All life and warmth leached out of the air. If I close my eyes I'll crash.

Cold finds its way into everything. Why did I agree to do this? Everything freezes before my eyes. All life and warmth leached out of the air. 
Snow stinging the eyes. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I've gone 42 meters now. And meters and meters to go. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. I have to keep breathing. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
I have to keep breathing. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Peak skiing performance. I have to find comfort in this. Until the next crash.
 
One ski in front of the other. More cold than my body can sustain. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
An eternity of winter. More cold than my body can sustain. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
Snow like static in the ears. All life and warmth leached out of the air. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
I've gone 32 meters now. Such a small number, on paper. 
Gravity controls me completely. 
One ski in front of the other. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. I can't focus on skiing straight. 
Snow stinging the eyes. Before me is more of the same. My clothes barely protect me. Air that annihilates. 
Everything freezes before my eyes. Chill down to the nerve endings. The people passing by all look the same. How far down can this slope go? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I can still do tricks, it seems. Small comforts.
 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. 
Have I been skiing for an hour? Two hours? Two days? It all feels the same. 
The trees must be moving. 
One ski in front of the other. 
I've gone 27 meters now. Is that all? 
Cold finds its way into everything. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
Chill down to the nerve endings. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
Snow like static in the ears. Nothing like a wonderland. 
Colder than cold. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. I have to keep breathing. Everything freezes before my eyes.

Have I been skiing for an hour? Two hours? Two days? It all feels the same. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last.

I've gone 21 meters now. And meters and meters to go. 
Snow like static in the ears.

Cold deep in the bones. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. I can still do tricks, it seems. Somehow I'm still intact.
 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
How far down can this slope go? Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
Every minute seems to last hours. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. Air that annihilates. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
An infinity of ice. 
I've gone 10 meters now. I feel each meter in my aching bones. 
Why did I agree to do this? Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. 
I'm going 16 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Peak skiing performance. Somehow I'm still intact.
 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? 
Cold deep in the bones.

If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. There is only one option: keep skiing. Nothing like a wonderland. The people passing by all look the same. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
An eternity of winter. The slope will end in time. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. 
It feels like I've been skiing forever. 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Air that annihilates. 
I've gone 1040 meters now. I won't say I'm lost. I can't.

THEY ALWAYS FIND THEIR WAY HERE
 
Cold finds its way into everything. 
I've gone 1047 meters now. Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. I could die out here. Freezing to death suddenly seems so possible. 
These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I'm downed. Every crash makes me weaker. Every crash makes me weaker. Have to get my bearings. Can't get them.

I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Chill down to the nerve endings. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. The people passing by all look the same. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
An eternity of winter. Nothing like a wonderland. Everything freezes before my eyes. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I've gone 1178 meters now. I don't want to be here anymore. Screaming will make it worse. I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Selective sensory deprivation. 
Everything freezes before my eyes. Ice encrusting everything in view. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. Everyone else here seems so impossibly fast. 
The snow never ceases. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Keep moving. There is no other choice. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
Just keep going... If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
Gravity controls me completely. Why did I agree to do this? Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
Gravity controls me completely. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. My clothes barely protect me. Air that annihilates. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I've gone 1183 meters now. The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. I don't want to be here anymore. I long so much for warmth. Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. 
The snow is infinite. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. If I go faster I might crash. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. Ice encrusting everything in view. Selective sensory deprivation. 
No time to shiver. I have to keep breathing. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. I have to keep breathing. 
Wind like encroaching walls. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
One ski in front of the other. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Air that annihilates. 
I've gone 1188 meters now. The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. If anything happened to me, the snow would bury any trace. Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. 
Cold deep in the bones. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
An eternity of winter. No time to shiver. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. Endless slope in this direction too. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
Cold deep in the bones. All life and warmth leached out of the air. More cold than my body can sustain. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
No time to shiver. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Air that annihilates. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
Just keep going... 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
Half the trees are splintered dead. Just keep going... 
I've gone 1193 meters now. My body is stinging. Frostbite? Or something else? 
Where have all the people gone? Keep moving. There is no other choice. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. An all-encompassing sense of chill. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. Steady lets me survive. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
Gravity controls me completely. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
The scenery looks like a snowglobe: picturesque, inescapable. Nothing like a wonderland. All life and warmth leached out of the air. More cold than my body can sustain. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. Selective sensory deprivation. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
One ski in front of the other. Air that annihilates. 
Chill down to the nerve endings. A thousand ways to describe the cold. Nothing to do but ski and survive. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
I've gone 1199 meters now. A man topples over and falls fast. Something in his movement unsettles me, but before I can place it he's there and gone. My body is stinging. Frostbite? Or something else? 
Cold finds its way into everything. No time to shiver. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. Before me is more of the same. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. I ski at a slant, not fully downhill.

There are no landmarks anywhere. The people passing by all look the same. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I've gone 1204 meters now. My body is stinging. Frostbite? Or something else? My body doesn't ache exactly, and yet it feels like it should. An unending expanse produces its own kind of claustrophobia. I feel my skin go numb, unresponsive. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. More cold than my body can sustain. My clothes barely protect me. 
I'm going 8 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. Every element is its own pummeling force. Snow shrouds everything around me. If I close my eyes I'll crash.

Snow shrouds everything around me. An all-encompassing sense of chill. More cold than my body can sustain. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I've gone 1210 meters now. I wore bright clothes to stand out against the ice. That's what they told me to do. I shouldn't have listened. I try to remember the outside world. I remember nothing. The landscape is atrophying, and so am I. It all feels wrong. 
The scenery blurs into itself. My legs would ache if I could feel them. Before me is more of the same. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
I'm going 13 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
A man whizzes by with impossible, inhuman speed. How far down can this slope go? Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.

Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. 
I've gone 1220 meters now. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. 
An eternity of winter. 
These people leave no footprints. Nor do the skis. Nothing leaves a mark. There is only one option: keep skiing. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. The people passing by all look the same.

The reward for braving snow is more snow. My legs would ache if I could feel them. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
Snow stinging the eyes. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. The slope will end in time. 
Snow like static in the ears. A thousand ways to describe the cold. Where have all the people gone? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. 
No watches are allowed here. 
An eternity of winter. All life and warmth leached out of the air. How far down can this slope go? 
Colder than cold. 
I've gone 1372 meters now. I shouldn't have come. I try to remember the outside world. I remember nothing. Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. 
One ski in front of the other. My clothes barely protect me. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
No time to shiver. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I'm going 10 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. Snow shrouds everything around me. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 

WE HAVE NO ENDING
 
Half the trees are splintered dead. Just keep going... How far down can this slope go? These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
Everything freezes before my eyes. Before me is more of the same. How far down can this slope go? 
An infinity of ice. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
Selective sensory deprivation. If I close my eyes I'll crash. Every element is its own pummeling force. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
One ski in front of the other. More cold than my body can sustain. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Just keep going... 
I've gone 1378 meters now. The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. If anything happened to me, the snow would bury any trace. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. The people passing by all look the same. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. 
I'm going 8 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 
Colder than cold. The slope will end in time. Selective sensory deprivation. No time to shiver. 
If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Chill down to the nerve endings. Just keep going... 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
Snow like static in the ears. Every element is its own pummeling force. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. Where have all the people gone? 
Chill down to the nerve endings. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Selective sensory deprivation. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. There is only one option: keep skiing. More cold than my body can sustain. 
I've gone 1383 meters now. I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're slowly strangling me. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
Colder than cold. There is only one option: keep skiing. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. How far down can this slope go? Just keep going... I have to keep breathing. 
Cold deep in the bones. My legs would ache if I could feel them. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
Everything freezes before my eyes. Why did I agree to do this? There is only one option: keep skiing. 
No time to shiver. Keep moving. There is no other choice. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I've gone 1388 meters now. The farther I go, the quieter it gets. I don't want to be here anymore. Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. 
One ski in front of the other. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
Cold deep in the bones. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
Snow like static in the ears. An all-encompassing sense of chill.

Snow and snow and snow and snow. 
A world of nothing but ice. How far down can this slope go? If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Nothing like a wonderland. 
I've gone 1394 meters now. The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. If anything happened to me, the snow would bury any trace. Is death warmer than here? My body doesn't ache exactly, and yet it feels like it should. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Nothing to do but ski and survive. The slope will end in time. 
An eternity of winter. No time to shiver. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. If I go faster I might crash. 
Cold finds its way into everything. Air that annihilates. Just keep going... 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
Gravity controls me completely. Just keep going... Ice encrusting everything in view. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
Wind like encroaching walls. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Every element is its own pummeling force. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I've gone 1397 meters now. There are scents now, each more acrid than the last. It all feels wrong. If anything happened to me, the snow would bury any trace. 
Half the trees are splintered dead. My clothes barely protect me. 
Gravity controls me completely. 
I'm going 5 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
The snow never ceases. My legs would ache if I could feel them. Snow shrouds everything around me. Before me is more of the same. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.

IN THE END THEY'RE ALWAYS DRAWN
 
One ski in front of the other. How far down can this slope go? 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. My legs would ache if I could feel them. An all-encompassing sense of chill. How far down can this slope go? 
Maybe a break will restore me. 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? 
I don't remember when I started holding my breath. Something is holding it for me. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
Snow stinging the eyes. 
No time to shiver. Selective sensory deprivation. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. Where have all the people gone? 
I've gone 1398 meters now. I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're slowly strangling me. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. 
Why did I agree to do this? All life and warmth leached out of the air. Every element is its own pummeling force. Snow shrouds everything around me. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
Everything freezes before my eyes. More cold than my body can sustain. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I'm going 3 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS

Snow that deafens and numbs. 
I've gone 1403 meters now. The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. 

THEY ALWAYS FIND THEIR WAY HERE
 
An infinity of ice. 
The snow is infinite. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I'm going 13 meters per hour. I move in a winding path.

THE TIME HAS COME
 
How far down can this slope go? Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I've gone 1410 meters now. I feel my skin go numb, unresponsive. I'll never ski again. Snowdrifts start to look like chasms. Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. 
A man whizzes by with impossible, inhuman speed. Just keep going... No time to shiver. 
How far down can this slope go? There is only one option: keep skiing. Where have all the people gone? 
Crashed. I don't see what hit me until it's too late. Every time I fall I fear it's the last. Another skier whizzes by my downed body. He doesn't even notice. 
Gravity controls me completely. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?

I'm downed. I've got no control over my body. The crash doesn't hurt exactly. It's more that I know it should. Have to get my bearings. Can't get them. Every crash makes me weaker.

Snow, then snow, and snow again. My clothes barely protect me. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. No time to shiver. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Everything freezes before my eyes. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Nothing to do but ski and survive. The slope will end in time. 
I've gone 1486 meters now. Every tree I pass looks battered, gangrenous. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. Nothing like a wonderland. Ice encrusting everything in view. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
Maybe a break will restore me. The slope looks infinite when viewed from the ground. Gravity could keep me down here forever. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. 
The snow is infinite. A thousand ways to describe the cold. Air that annihilates. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
Everything freezes before my eyes. The slope will end in time. My clothes barely protect me. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Before me is more of the same. Just keep going... 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
Air that annihilates. 
Snow like static in the ears. My clothes barely protect me. Everything freezes before my eyes. Just keep going... 
I've gone 1488 meters now. The farther I go, the quieter it gets. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
Cold finds its way into everything. Ice encrusting everything in view. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
How far down can this slope go? If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
How far down can this slope go? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
The scenery blurs into itself. Selective sensory deprivation. How far down can this slope go? Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? Chill down to the nerve endings. Why did I agree to do this? 
Snow that deafens and numbs. 
I've gone 1494 meters now. A wasteland of ice now. I could die out here. I'll never ski again. Surely I should have seen the bottom by now. 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. 
Snow like static in the ears. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
An infinity of ice. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
Where have all the people gone? A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
No time to shiver. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
No watches are allowed here. 
Chill down to the nerve endings. Everything freezes before my eyes. Ice encrusting everything in view. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. I have to keep breathing. 
I've gone 1499 meters now. Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. The landscape is atrophying, and so am I. The only way out is down. Right? 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. There must be a boundary to the slope somewhere... 
An infinity of ice. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
Air that annihilates. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
An eternity of winter. 
An infinity of ice. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. Selective sensory deprivation. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
An eternity of winter. 
The snow is infinite. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I've gone 1504 meters now. The air sends spines to my face. 
The snow never ceases. The slope will end in time. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Selective sensory deprivation. 
Cold deep in the bones. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. Everyone else here seems so impossibly fast. 
Gravity controls me completely. Where have all the people gone? 
An infinity of ice. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
Snow stinging the eyes. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
No time to shiver. Snow shrouds everything around me. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Snow like static in the ears. More cold than my body can sustain. Everything freezes before my eyes. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I've gone 1510 meters now. Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. Snowdrifts start to look like chasms. I'll never ski again. Freezing to death suddenly seems so possible. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Where have all the people gone? 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
Just keep going... Selective sensory deprivation. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. Endless slope in this direction too.

A man whizzes by with impossible, inhuman speed. Nothing to do but ski and survive. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I've gone 1512 meters now. A wasteland of ice now. If anything happened to me, the snow would bury any trace. I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. The only way out is down. Right? 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. Selective sensory deprivation. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
The scenery blurs into itself. I have to keep breathing. 
I pause to catch my breath. But it remains the same. 
An eternity of winter. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Every element is its own pummeling force.

I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
How far down can this slope go? 
I've gone 1512 meters now. The farther I go, the quieter it gets. I try to remember the outside world. I remember nothing. Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. I don't want to be here anymore. 
Wind like encroaching walls. How far down can this slope go? Air that annihilates. The people passing by all look the same. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
I'm going 3 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. The people passing by all look the same. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. All life and warmth leached out of the air. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Everything freezes before my eyes.

I just hope this will be over quick. 
Just keep going... The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Colder than cold. 
I've gone 1517 meters now. A woman freezes. From a tree, a tendril. Tendrils around the skis, the hair, the rest. And then, snow. I long so much for warmth. I could die out here. I shouldn't have come. 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I'm going 5 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 
A world of nothing but ice. 
One ski in front of the other. More cold than my body can sustain. Before me is more of the same. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.

I've gone 1518 meters now. A bush is burning. Don't think about it. Screaming will make it worse. I don't want to be here anymore. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? Everything freezes before my eyes. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
Selective sensory deprivation. 
Maybe a break will restore me. Gravity could keep me down here forever. Did I really think stopping would help?

I'm downed. I lie motionless, half-frozen. Every time I fall I fear it's the last. Another skier whizzes by my downed body. He doesn't even notice. 
The snow is infinite. Nothing like a wonderland. My legs would ache if I could feel them. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
Gravity controls me completely. No time to shiver. Before me is more of the same. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Nothing like a wonderland. The slope will end in time. How far down can this slope go? 
I just hope this will be over quick. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
A world of nothing but ice. 

THEY ALWAYS FIND THEIR WAY HERE
 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. Ice encrusting everything in view. I have to keep breathing. 
I've gone 1605 meters now. Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. My body doesn't ache exactly, and yet it feels like it should. My peripheral vision is gone. Just tunnel vision forward. 

THEIR COMPULSION TO SEE IT TO THE END
 
Snow that deafens and numbs. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. My legs would ache if I could feel them. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
An infinity of ice. Why did I agree to do this? The slope will end in time. 
I'm going 9 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 
Cold deep in the bones. Where have all the people gone? 
Selective sensory deprivation. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Colder than cold. Nothing to do but ski and survive. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 

WE HAVE NO ENDING
 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. All life and warmth leached out of the air. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I've gone 1613 meters now. The farther I go, the quieter it gets. Is death warmer than here? Every tree I pass looks battered, gangrenous. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
Selective sensory deprivation. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. Turning takes more and more effort. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. 
Gravity controls me completely. Keep moving. There is no other choice. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I've gone 1620 meters now. I don't want to be here anymore. Snow gives way to fetid slush. 
Snow stinging the eyes. 
The snow never ceases. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
I'm going 8 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
Cold deep in the bones. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
A man whizzes by with impossible, inhuman speed. A thousand ways to describe the cold. No time to shiver. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
Half the trees are splintered dead. My legs would ache if I could feel them. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
No watches are allowed here. 

WE HAVE NO ENDING
 
Snow like static in the ears. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Selective sensory deprivation. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I've gone 1625 meters now. The only thing more unsettling than a darkening sky: a sky that never darkens. It all feels wrong. I could die out here. Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. There is only one option: keep skiing. Everything freezes before my eyes. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. My skis slash erratically, not fully left nor right. 
The scenery blurs into itself. Just keep going... 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
There are no landmarks anywhere. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing.

I have to keep breathing. No time to shiver.

Crashed. Face meets snow. Have to get my bearings. Can't get them.

I don't remember when I started holding my breath. Something is holding it for me. My clothes barely protect me. 
No time to shiver. 
The slope passes me by. Gravity could keep me down here forever.

I ski on autopilot, outside myself. The slope will end in time. Air that annihilates. 
I've gone 1857 meters now. Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. My peripheral vision is gone. Just tunnel vision forward. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
A world of nothing but ice. 

THEY ALWAYS FIND THEIR WAY HERE
 
These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. Before me is more of the same. 
Airborne, going 30 meters per hour. From the air, the ground seems impossibly far away. The slope looks far too vast beneath me. The wind's too loud up here. It wants me down. I have to trust there's flat ground below. I can't look down. 
Cold deep in the bones. Before me is more of the same. 

THE TIME HAS COME
 
Cold finds its way into everything. The slope will end in time. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Snow like static in the ears. 
Selective sensory deprivation. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. 

IN THE END THEY'RE ALWAYS DRAWN
 
Wind like encroaching walls. Air that annihilates. 
I've gone 1877 meters now. The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
No time to shiver. Nothing to do but ski and survive. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. The people passing by all look the same. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
Gravity controls me completely. Before me is more of the same. Yet they said this was the best skiing anywhere. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Airborne, going 30 meters per hour. Flying, or flailing. The slope looks far too vast beneath me. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
Selective sensory deprivation. How far down can this slope go? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
Wind like encroaching walls. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. My legs would ache if I could feel them. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Cold finds its way into everything. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
Everything freezes before my eyes. Before me is more of the same. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
Everything freezes before my eyes. Air that annihilates. An all-encompassing sense of chill. My clothes barely protect me. 
I've gone 1883 meters now. Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? I shouldn't have come. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. My clothes barely protect me. 
These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. The slope will end in time. 
Airborne, going 22 meters per hour. I flail through the air, out of control. I have to trust there's flat ground below. I can't look down. 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? The people passing by all look the same. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. A thousand ways to describe the cold. The slope will end in time. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
The snow is infinite. Snow shrouds everything around me. Why did I agree to do this? 
A man whizzes by with impossible, inhuman speed. Ice encrusting everything in view. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. All life and warmth leached out of the air. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 

WE ARE WHERE YOUR EYESIGHT ENDS
 
Half the trees are splintered dead. Where have all the people gone? Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I've gone 1883 meters now. The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. Snowdrifts start to look like chasms. 
A world of nothing but ice. Air that annihilates. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I'm downed. I don't see what hit me until it's too late. 
Snow like static in the ears. 

WE HAVE NO ENDING
 
Half the trees are splintered dead. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
Cold deep in the bones. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. No time to shiver. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. Snow shrouds everything around me. 

THEY ALWAYS FIND THEIR WAY HERE
 
The trees must be moving. If I close my eyes I'll crash. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I've gone 1883 meters now. Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. I long so much for warmth. Snowdrifts arranged like open graves. Snowdrifts start to look like chasms. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
Snow like static in the ears. 
Everything freezes before my eyes. Air that annihilates. Selective sensory deprivation. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I'm downed. Face meets snow.

Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. The slope will end in time. 
I'm downed. I don't see what hit me until it's too late. Every time I fall I fear it's the last. Have to get my bearings. Can't get them. 
A world of nothing but ice. No time to shiver.

An infinity of ice. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
The snow is infinite. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I've gone 1881 meters now. Footprints, but not in a pattern. Snowdrifts start to look like chasms. I feel my skin go numb, unresponsive. 
An eternity of winter. These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. Ice encrusting everything in view. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. 
I pause to catch my breath. But it remains the same. Did I really think stopping would help? I'll get up if I feel ready. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
An eternity of winter. My legs would ache if I could feel them.

No watches are allowed here. 
Cold finds its way into everything. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
Snow stinging the eyes. 
I've gone 1878 meters now. The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. Nothing like a wonderland. More cold than my body can sustain. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
The snow never ceases. If I close my eyes I'll crash. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I'll never reach the top at this rate. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
There are no landmarks anywhere. 

WE HAVE NO ENDING
 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. No time to shiver. Selective sensory deprivation. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
Air that annihilates.

THEIR COMPULSION TO SEE IT TO THE END
 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
Snow like static in the ears. 
The trip uphill is agonizingly slow. 

IN THE END THEY'RE ALWAYS DRAWN

A man whizzes by with impossible, inhuman speed. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform.

Snow shrouds everything around me. My clothes barely protect me. 
Cold finds its way into everything. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
Snow stinging the eyes. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
An infinity of ice. My legs would ache if I could feel them. The slope will end in time. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. Nothing like a wonderland. More cold than my body can sustain. 
I don't have a way to tell time. Just my internal clock. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. The people passing by all look the same. 
I've gone 1991 meters now. Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. I could die out here. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
Snow like static in the ears. My clothes barely protect me. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
The snow is infinite. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. All life and warmth leached out of the air. I have to keep breathing. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. More cold than my body can sustain. The slope will end in time. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. A thousand ways to describe the cold. 
Colder than cold. 
No watches are allowed here. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
There is only one option: keep skiing. 
One ski in front of the other. 
I've gone 1996 meters now. The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. Perverse, empty nostalgia for the slope before. 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
Wind like encroaching walls. How far down can this slope go? 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
The snow never ceases. Nothing to do but ski and survive. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. I move in a winding path. 
Cold finds its way into everything. All life and warmth leached out of the air. How far down can this slope go? Before me is more of the same. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
Cold finds its way into everything. The slope will end in time. Snow shrouds everything around me. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
A world of nothing but ice. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
The snow never ceases. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
No watches are allowed here. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. The people passing by all look the same. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Just keep going... 
Chill down to the nerve endings. I have to keep breathing. 
I've gone too far. Every tree I pass looks battered, gangrenous. too far too far too far 
Cold deep in the bones. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Ice encrusting everything in view. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I'm going 9 meters per hour. I fight to steady myself as I turn. 
Cold finds its way into everything. 
These menacing, craggy boulders at every turn. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Where have all the people gone? 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
Snow stinging the eyes. I have to keep breathing. My clothes barely protect me. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
One ski in front of the other. No time to shiver. Every element is its own pummeling force. 
One ski in front of the other. More cold than my body can sustain. 
I've gone too far. It occurs to me that the slope wants me gone. Everyone else is safe. They only want me... 
An eternity of winter. Just keep going... 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE

No watches are allowed here. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I've gone too far. Footprints, but not in a pattern. Don't think just ski don't think just ski. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. Before me is more of the same. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. I'm maneuvering around something, but I can barely see what. 
Cold deep in the bones. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. 
An infinity of ice. No time to shiver. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.

Half the trees are splintered dead. Snow shrouds everything around me. My clothes barely protect me. 

THEIR COMPULSION TO SEE IT TO THE END
 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. Imposing hulks of conifer everywhere. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.

Wind like encroaching walls. If I close my eyes I'll crash. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Why did I agree to do this?

I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I pause to catch my breath. But it remains the same. The slope looks infinite when viewed from the ground. Did I really think stopping would help? 
Chill down to the nerve endings. Every element is its own pummeling force. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. How far down can this slope go? Selective sensory deprivation. The people passing by all look the same. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
Cold finds its way into everything. All life and warmth leached out of the air. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. A snowboarder passes by with a confidence I lack. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
Colder than cold.

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. 

THE TIME HAS COME
 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. 
Every minute seems to last hours. 
One ski in front of the other. 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. Chill down to the nerve endings. 
I've gone too far. The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore here. I'm surrounded. Have to keep skiing.

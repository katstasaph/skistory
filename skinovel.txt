I told myself I wasn't going to ski long. 
Or ski far. 
Or ski too fast. 
I don't know how to ski.
 
I try to remember whether I brought a watch. 
I've gone 0 meters now. 
The snowfall keeps me down. Did I really think stopping would help? The slope looks infinite when viewed from the ground. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But out here there's no way to know.
 
I try to remember whether I brought a watch. 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. 
Colder than cold. 
I've gone 0 meters now. 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
A sign tells me how to gain better control. But I don't understand what it's telling me. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I'm going 3 meters per hour. 
The slope was established in 1991, according to a sign. Who did it? What was here before? Was it anything? 
Why did I agree to do this? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But out here there's no way to know.
 
Gravity controls me completely. The people passing by all look the same. 
They briefed me on the symbols for the difficulty of slopes. Green circle, easy. Blue square, medium. Black diamond, hard. Every ski slope has one. But this one didn't. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. If I close my eyes I'll crash. Where have all the people gone? 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. Just keep going... There is only one option: keep skiing. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
The scenery blurs into itself. The slope will end in time. The people passing by all look the same. 
I've gone 2 meters now. 
Snow stinging the eyes. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Colder than cold. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I'm going 13 meters per hour. 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
The scenery blurs into itself. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing I have a sense of is passing time.
 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. 
Snow like static in the ears. If I close my eyes I'll crash. The slope will end in time. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
Half the trees are splintered dead. Ice encrusting everything in view. My legs would ache if I could feel them. Why did I agree to do this? 
Snow that deafens and numbs. How far down can this slope go? The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. No time to shiver. 
I've gone 8 meters now. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. 
The scenery looks like a snowglobe: picturesque, inescapable. Air that annihilates. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. 
Cold finds its way into everything. The people passing by all look the same. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. As if anyone's keeping score.
 
The scenery blurs into itself. Keep moving. There is no other choice. How far down can this slope go? 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
One ski in front of the other. No time to shiver. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
Colder than cold. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I've gone 20 meters now. 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. The people passing by all look the same.

I think about the fact that a person created this place, laid it out and scattered the snow and cut the trees and smoothed the slope and invited the world. They would want it to be safe. I have to remember that. Ice encrusting everything in view. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. There is only one option: keep skiing. Keep moving. There is no other choice.

Snow and snow and snow and snow.

Snow, then snow, and snow again. 
I've gone 26 meters now. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. An all-encompassing sense of chill. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Gravity controls me completely. The people passing by all look the same. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. 
The snow is infinite. No time to shiver. 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. I have to keep breathing. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Peak skiing performance.
 
The snow never ceases. My legs would ache if I could feel them. Snow shrouds everything around me.

It feels like I've been skiing forever. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. The people passing by all look the same. I have to keep breathing. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
The snow is infinite. No time to shiver. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Air that annihilates. 
I've gone 21 meters now. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. I have to keep breathing. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. 
Gravity controls me completely. Nothing to do but ski and survive. There is only one option: keep skiing.

Wind like encroaching walls. Just keep going... Air that annihilates. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The surge of confidence keeps me going. Another meter at least. Until the next crash.
 
One ski in front of the other. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
How far down can this slope go? But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Ice encrusting everything in view. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
A world of nothing but ice. Air that annihilates. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I've gone 5 meters now. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. 
Half the trees are splintered dead. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I'm going 10 meters per hour. 
Wind like encroaching walls. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. How far down can this slope go? 
Snow like static in the ears.

Colder than cold. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Why did I agree to do this? 
I've gone 1040 meters now. Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
Why did I agree to do this? There is only one option: keep skiing. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I'm going 17 meters per hour.

I've gone 1050 meters now. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. There are scents now, each more acrid than the last. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. If I close my eyes I'll crash.

These people leave no footprints. Nor do the skis. Nothing leaves a mark. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH

The trick is to never let yourself stop. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Ice encrusting everything in view. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. Everything freezes before my eyes. I have to keep breathing. 
I've gone 1214 meters now. The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. 
Wind like encroaching walls. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Just keep going... 
Gravity controls me completely. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. If I close my eyes I'll crash. No time to shiver. 
I pause to catch my breath. But it remains the same. The slope looks infinite when viewed from the ground. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Cold finds its way into everything. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
Just keep going... But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. The people passing by all look the same. Why did I agree to do this? 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
Just keep going... No time to shiver. The people passing by all look the same. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
The snow is infinite. Keep moving. There is no other choice. How far down can this slope go? 
I've gone 1214 meters now. I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're slowly strangling me. The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore. The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. 
Why did I agree to do this? 
The snow is infinite. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
The slope passes me by. Did I really think stopping would help? 
Everything freezes before my eyes. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
Snow stinging the eyes. Keep moving. There is no other choice. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
There is only one option: keep skiing. Nothing to do but ski and survive. The people passing by all look the same. 
Just keep going... But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I try to remember whether I brought a watch. 
No time to shiver. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I've gone 1214 meters now. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. 
The snow never ceases. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. 
The snowfall keeps me down. Gravity could keep me down here forever. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Nothing to do but ski and survive. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
Cold finds its way into everything. No time to shiver. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze.

Cold deep in the bones. Keep moving. There is no other choice. The people passing by all look the same. 
I've gone 1215 meters now. The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. A man drifts past me. His eyes are dead. I can't say for certain the rest of him isn't. 
Just keep going... Why did I agree to do this? 
Half the trees are splintered dead. The people passing by all look the same. 
I'm going 6 meters per hour. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. I have to keep breathing. 

THE TIME HAS COME
 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Air that annihilates. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Just keep going... 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. No time to shiver. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
Wind like encroaching walls. Ice encrusting everything in view. How far down can this slope go? 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
Cold finds its way into everything. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I've gone 1220 meters now. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. It occurs to me that the slope wants me gone. I can't stop moving. The snow will swallow me, I know. 
These people leave no footprints. Nor do the skis. Nothing leaves a mark. I have to keep breathing. Air that annihilates. 
Everything freezes before my eyes. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour.

Cold deep in the bones. Just keep going... 
I've gone 1225 meters now. Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. The route is far behind me. There are no routes anymore.

I try to remember whether I brought a watch. 
There is only one option: keep skiing. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. The people passing by all look the same. 
The scenery blurs into itself. 
I've gone 1305 meters now. I should have reached the bottom by now. It occurs to me that the slope wants me gone. I won't say I'm lost. I can't. No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. 
Snow stinging the eyes. Why did I agree to do this? The farther I go, the steeper it looks. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
The snow never ceases. Ice encrusting everything in view. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. 
Wind like encroaching walls. Everything freezes before my eyes. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. Why did I agree to do this? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. Why did I agree to do this? The slope will end in time. Just keep going... 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 
Gravity controls me completely. If I close my eyes I'll crash. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. The slope will end in time. I have to keep breathing. 
I've gone 1310 meters now. Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. 
Everything freezes before my eyes. 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. 
Just keep going... 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
Snow like static in the ears. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Just keep going... I have to keep breathing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
A world of nothing but ice. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
The scenery blurs into itself. Snow shrouds everything around me. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I try to remember whether I brought a watch. 
The scenery looks like a snowglobe: picturesque, inescapable. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
No time to shiver. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I've gone 1316 meters now. The footprints don't look like footprints anymore. They look like trails. Like being dragged and leaving marks. It occurs to me that the slope wants me gone. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. No time to shiver. Ice encrusting everything in view. The slope will end in time. 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. An all-encompassing sense of chill. If I close my eyes I'll crash. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 

THE TIME HAS COME
 
There are no landmarks anywhere. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
Just keep going... 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Why did I agree to do this? The slope will end in time. 
I try to remember whether I brought a watch. 

THEIR COMPULSION TO SEE IT TO THE END
 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
Cold deep in the bones. 
I've gone 1321 meters now. I should have reached the bottom by now. Footprints, but not in a pattern. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. How far down can this slope go? 
I'm going 8 meters per hour. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
The scenery looks like a snowglobe: picturesque, inescapable. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Ice encrusting everything in view.

Snow that deafens and numbs. Just keep going... But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. The slope will end in time. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
The snow never ceases. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Air that annihilates. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. If I close my eyes I'll crash. Nothing to do but ski and survive. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I've gone 1326 meters now. The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else.

I've gone 1331 meters now. Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. The air around me sounds like it's hissing. No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. How far down can this slope go?

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
The snow is infinite. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Snow shrouds everything around me.

My legs would ache if I could feel them. 

IN THE END THEY'RE ALWAYS DRAWN
 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. No time to shiver. 
I've gone 1448 meters now. I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're slowly strangling me. The footprints don't look like footprints anymore. They look like trails. Like being dragged and leaving marks. I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. My legs would ache if I could feel them. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
Gravity controls me completely. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
Crashed. I don't see what hit me until it's too late. 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. Where have all the people gone? If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. The people passing by all look the same. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
Each breath takes more effort than the last. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Why did I agree to do this? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
Everything freezes before my eyes. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. My legs would ache if I could feel them. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
Wind like encroaching walls. There is only one option: keep skiing. How far down can this slope go? 

THEY ALWAYS FIND THEIR WAY HERE
 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. An all-encompassing sense of chill. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Where have all the people gone? 
I've gone 1448 meters now. No chance now of anyone finding me. It's too far. The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. A bush is burning. Don't think about it. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. No time to shiver. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
The scenery blurs into itself. How far down can this slope go? Everything freezes before my eyes. The people passing by all look the same. 
Crashed. I lie motionless, half-frozen. 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? The slope will end in time. I have to keep breathing. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
The scenery looks like a snowglobe: picturesque, inescapable. An all-encompassing sense of chill. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Everything freezes before my eyes. The slope will end in time.

The reward for braving snow is more snow. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I've gone 1448 meters now. I don't want to be here anymore. It occurs to me that the slope wants me gone. Still no end in sight. Nothing. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
Half the trees are splintered dead. 
One ski in front of the other. Air that annihilates. The slope will end in time. No time to shiver. 
I'm going 2 meters per hour. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Air that annihilates. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. My legs would ache if I could feel them. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
Colder than cold. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Why did I agree to do this? 
Snow shrouds everything around me. 
I've gone 1452 meters now. The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. 
One ski in front of the other. Air that annihilates. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze.

THE TIME HAS COME
 
Snow like static in the ears. Everything freezes before my eyes. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Why did I agree to do this?

A world of nothing but ice. If I close my eyes I'll crash. Nothing to do but ski and survive. Ice encrusting everything in view.

I've gone 1572 meters now. A bush is burning. Don't think about it. 
Gravity controls me completely. Everything freezes before my eyes. 
The snow never ceases. Why did I agree to do this? But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Air that annihilates. 
How far down can this slope go? Keep moving. There is no other choice. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
The snow never ceases. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
One ski in front of the other. Why did I agree to do this? If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. I have to keep breathing. The slope will end in time. 
I've gone 1573 meters now. I no longer remember the sensation of warmth. The footprints don't look like footprints anymore. They look like trails. Like being dragged and leaving marks. 
I have to keep breathing. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. Just keep going... 
The snowfall keeps me down. I'll get up if I feel ready. 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. How far down can this slope go? The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
How far down can this slope go? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
Snow shrouds everything around me. Air that annihilates. Snow shrouds everything around me. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. 
I try to remember whether I brought a watch. 
Colder than cold. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I've gone 1576 meters now. Footprints, but not in a pattern. There are scents now, each more acrid than the last. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. Nothing to do but ski and survive. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I'm going 9 meters per hour. 
Colder than cold. Keep moving. There is no other choice. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. Just keep going... The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
How far down can this slope go? But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. 
I try to remember whether I brought a watch. 
The scenery blurs into itself. 
One ski in front of the other. 
I've gone 1585 meters now. The colors are sickeningly bright against the snow. Too bright to be real. I don't want to be here anymore. I can't stop moving. The snow will swallow me, I know. 
Cold deep in the bones. Nothing to do but ski and survive. There is only one option: keep skiing. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I'm going 18 meters per hour. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. No time to shiver. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
Snow like static in the ears. There is only one option: keep skiing. The people passing by all look the same. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. How far down can this slope go? Air that annihilates. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
Snow that deafens and numbs. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Air that annihilates. 
Cold finds its way into everything. No time to shiver. Air that annihilates. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I've gone 1585 meters now. A bush is burning. Don't think about it. The world around me seems to close in, to move against me, impenetrable. There are scents now, each more acrid than the last. I should have reached the bottom by now. 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
Wind like encroaching walls. I have to keep breathing. Where have all the people gone? Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
The snow never ceases. Air that annihilates. There is only one option: keep skiing. The people passing by all look the same. 
I'm going 9 meters per hour. 
The snow is infinite. No time to shiver. 
Do I have any skin left to go numb? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
Just keep going... I have to keep breathing. 

THEY ALWAYS FIND THEIR WAY HERE
 
I don't remember when I started holding my breath. Something is holding it for me. How far down can this slope go? The people passing by all look the same. Nothing to do but ski and survive.

The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. The slope will end in time. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
Snow like static in the ears. Everything freezes before my eyes. There is only one option: keep skiing. I have to keep breathing. 
I've gone 1585 meters now. Wind sounds like shrieking, when there's enough of it. Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. Another dog trots by. Or is it fleeing? I don't want to be here anymore. 
Colder than cold. Snow shrouds everything around me. Just keep going... 
Everything freezes before my eyes. How far down can this slope go? 
Crashed. Limbs topple over swaddled limbs and I'm facedown in the show. Another skier whizzes by my downed body. He doesn't even notice. The crash doesn't hurt exactly. It's more that I know it should. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. My legs would ache if I could feel them. The slope will end in time. 
Cold deep in the bones. Why did I agree to do this? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
Snow like static in the ears. Just keep going... There is only one option: keep skiing. 

NO ESCAPE NO ESCAPE
 
I don't remember when I started holding my breath. Something is holding it for me. Why did I agree to do this? The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
The scenery blurs into itself. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 
Colder than cold. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I've gone 1587 meters now. The only thing more unsettling than a darkening sky: a sky that never darkens. I feel constricted in these clothes. Like they're slowly strangling me. Another sound: a bark, possibly from a dog. There is nothing else it can be. A wasteland of ice now. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Why did I agree to do this? 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? 
I'm going 8 meters per hour. 
One ski in front of the other. No time to shiver. I have to keep breathing. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?

Snow and snow and snow and snow. The slope will end in time. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. There is only one option: keep skiing. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 
If only I remembered what time it was. 

THEIR COMPULSION TO SEE IT TO THE END
 
Half the trees are splintered dead. No time to shiver. Just keep going... 
The scenery blurs into itself. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I've gone 1594 meters now. The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. 

THEY ALWAYS FIND THEIR WAY HERE
 
Where have all the people gone? 
Cold deep in the bones. Where have all the people gone? My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
I'm going 17 meters per hour. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. Nothing to do but ski and survive. I have to keep breathing. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere.

I've gone 1608 meters now. Snapping, shuffling sounds in the distance, growing with every meter. The only thing more unsettling than a darkening sky: a sky that never darkens. The footprints don't look like footprints anymore. They look like trails. Like being dragged and leaving marks. The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. 

ANY MINUTE NOW
 
The snow never ceases. No time to shiver. Keep moving. There is no other choice.

How far down can this slope go? The slope will end in time. How far down can this slope go? I have to keep breathing.

Snow that deafens and numbs. Where have all the people gone? Air that annihilates. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. Everything freezes before my eyes. Air that annihilates. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 

THE TIME HAS COME
 
No time to shiver. I have to keep breathing. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Everything freezes before my eyes. 

THEIR SKIS SOUND LIKE ANTICIPATION
 
Colder than cold. Keep moving. There is no other choice. If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
I've gone 1620 meters now. The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. 
Snow and snow and snow and snow. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. The slope will end in time. 
Somewhere I hear the bark of a dog. Ahead of me? Behind? I can't tell the difference. If I close my eyes I'll crash. The slope will end in time. 
I'm going 15 meters per hour. 
Snow like static in the ears. 
Half the trees are splintered dead. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
There are no landmarks anywhere. 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze.

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
Cold deep in the bones. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. The slope will end in time. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I've gone 1840 meters now. The snow seems denser here. Deep like quicksand. 
Gravity controls me completely. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. Just keep going... I have to keep breathing. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. 
Cold deep in the bones. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
If I close my eyes I'll crash. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
One ski in front of the other. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
Snow shrouds everything around me. The people passing by all look the same. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I just hope this will be over quick. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Ice encrusting everything in view. Just keep going... 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. Why did I agree to do this? 
I've gone 1854 meters now. The farther I go, the quieter it gets. There are scents now, each more acrid than the last. The snow begins to chatter. It must be the snow. There is nothing else. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. Ice encrusting everything in view. How far down can this slope go? 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I'm going 21 meters per hour. 
The snow is infinite. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Why did I agree to do this? 
Snow like static in the ears. There is only one option: keep skiing. Nothing to do but ski and survive. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.
 
Snow stinging the eyes. Air that annihilates. The slope will end in time. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. 
A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours.

An unnatural buzz to the wind. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. I have to keep breathing. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
I've gone 1868 meters now. Ski lifts keep heading upward. All full. None for me. I can't stop moving. The snow will swallow me, I know. A bush is burning. Don't think about it.

Snow shrouds everything around me. I have to keep breathing. There is only one option: keep skiing. I have to keep breathing.

One ski in front of the other. I have to keep breathing. My legs would ache if I could feel them. I have to keep breathing. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Ice encrusting everything in view. 
Crashed. I don't see what hit me until it's too late. Another skier whizzes by my downed body. He doesn't even notice. Whenever I fall I wonder when the last time will be.

Just keep going... If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. Ice encrusting everything in view. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I'm going 7 meters per hour. 
Snow that deafens and numbs. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Just keep going... An all-encompassing sense of chill. 

IN THE END THEY'RE ALWAYS DRAWN
 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Why?
 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. 

NO ESCAPE NO ESCAPE
 
An unnatural buzz to the wind. I have to keep breathing. Where have all the people gone? 
It feels like I've been skiing forever. 
Wind like encroaching walls. 

THE TIME HAS COME
 
Everything freezes before my eyes. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
I've gone -2011 meters now. Turning back like this is pointless. 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Air that annihilates. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. My legs would ache if I could feel them. The slope will end in time. 
The snowfall keeps me down. 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Keep moving. There is no other choice. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. Keep moving. There is no other choice. Where have all the people gone? An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 
Cold deep in the bones. 
How far down can this slope go? The slope will end in time. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
Colder than cold. 
There are no landmarks anywhere. Ice encrusting everything in view. The slope will end in time. 
I've gone -2011 meters now. 
I ski on autopilot, outside myself. No time to shiver. 

WE SEE YOU REGARDLESS OF ALL
 
One ski in front of the other. Air that annihilates. I ski on autopilot, outside myself. 
I pause to catch my breath. But it remains the same. I'll get up if I feel ready. Gravity could keep me down here forever. Gravity could keep me down here forever. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
A man whizzes by with impossible, inhuman speed. 
I have to keep breathing. My legs would ache if I could feel them. The people passing by all look the same. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. But skill won't save me.
 
An all-encompassing sense of chill. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
There is only one option: keep skiing. How far down can this slope go? Snow shrouds everything around me. An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I don't know how long I've been out here. 
One ski in front of the other. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. An all-encompassing sense of chill. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 
Snow stinging the eyes. My legs would ache if I could feel them. No time to shiver. 
I've gone 0 meters now. It takes all my energy to hoist my skis upward and go back. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
Cold finds its way into everything. 
I have to keep breathing. Keep moving. There is no other choice. 
Maybe a break will restore me. 
If I only focus, I'll get out of here faster. Snow shrouds everything around me. There is only one option: keep skiing. 
My legs would ache if I could feel them. Nothing to do but ski and survive. I have to keep breathing. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. The only thing that keeps me going.
 

THERE ARE MORE OF US THAN YOU
 
Everything freezes before my eyes. 

NO ESCAPE NO ESCAPE
 
The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. If I close my eyes I'll crash. I have to keep breathing. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 

EVEN THEIR MOVEMENT SATIATES
 
Gravity controls me completely. Snow shrouds everything around me. Everything freezes before my eyes. I have to keep breathing. 
The snow is infinite. 
I've gone 0 meters now. 
Just keep going... There is only one option: keep skiing. 

THEIR COMPULSION TO SEE IT TO THE END
 
Snow, then snow, and snow again. Ice encrusting everything in view. An all-encompassing sense of chill. Air that annihilates. 
The slope passes me by. I'll get up if I feel ready. The slope looks infinite when viewed from the ground. 
Half the trees are splintered dead. Everything freezes before my eyes. 

JUST LIKE THE ONE BEFORE
 
No time to shiver. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. My legs would ache if I could feel them. Why did I agree to do this? 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. These little habits I've already learned.
 
Cold beyond cold. Cold as in absence. But they said this was the best skiing anywhere. 

THIS ONE IS RECKLESS
 
The trick is to never let yourself stop. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
Where have all the people gone? Air that annihilates. My legs would ache if I could feel them. 

ANOTHER ONE IS COMING
 
Snow like static in the ears. Just keep going... An all-encompassing sense of chill. 
I've gone 0 meters now. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing. 

THEIR COMPULSION TO SEE IT TO THE END
 
I have to keep breathing. Why did I agree to do this? 
I pause to catch my breath. But it remains the same. Gravity could keep me down here forever. 
The scenery blurs into itself. 
The snow is infinite. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. The slope around me is so impossibly uniform. 
I ask myself how I'm skiing. Anything as a distraction.

NOWHERE WE CANNOT REACH
 
Just keep going... I have to keep breathing. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
Snow like static in the ears. 
Time has no meaning out here. Just motion. 
The reward for braving snow is more snow. The farther I go, the steeper it looks. Ice encrusting everything in view. The farther I go, the steeper it looks.

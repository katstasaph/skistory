I told myself I wasn't going to ski long.

Wind like encroaching walls. How far down does this slope go? 
Am I skiing well? 
A man drifts past me. His eyes are dead. I can't say for certain the rest of him isn't. 
Was that ski lift there before? And was it empty? 
I just hope this will be over quick. 
Out of the snow appears a ski lift. Inside are two men. They stare blankly and still. The snow moves more than they do. If I don't keep moving I'll freeze. 
The scenery blurs into itself. Why did I agree to do this? 
I've gone    00m now. 
Movement behind me; a noise. Whoosh, colder breeze, dusting up of snow. But when I turn, nothing.

A few minutes, and it already feels like I've been out here for hours. 
They briefed me on the symbols for the difficulty of slopes. Green circle, easy. Blue square, medium. Black diamond, hard. Every ski slope has one. But this one didn't. 
A finger goes numb. Then another. The numbness creeps up my arm and further down my body, in a strange pattern I can't quite place. 
I've gone    33m now. 
Cold in the bones.

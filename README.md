A novel generated by playing SkiFree for NaNoGenMo 2021.

This works by hooking into a running SkiFree process, using Deviare (https://github.com/nektra/Deviare2), intercepting and parsing changes to the strings shown in the UI (e.g., speed and distance traveled), and inferring in-game events from those.

Not included here: the 32-bit version of SkiFree for Windows, which can be downloaded for free: https://ski.ihoc.net/
